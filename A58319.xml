            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But becauſe that unſaciableneſs is never ſatisfied, but beſide thouſand of means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented already to quench the unquenchable greedines, it ſeeketh and findeth daily new and new means innumerable, ſo that it were an infinite labour to declare them all. I will wittingly, and purpoſedly paſſe them over, only taking one general ſentence, which ſhall be in ſtead of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> one of the great ſchoolmaſters of avarice, which could pick out profit of every thing (yea, even of mens urine) taught his Scholers (I meane the whole court of covetous perſons) this leſſon enſuing:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Lucri bonus odor caece qualibet.</l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:37337:5"/>
                     <l>Lucre is ſweet, and hath a good ſavour;</l>
                     <l>Though it come of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, dirt or Ordure.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This ſentence, if it be withdrawn from the filthy lucre of unſatiable covetouſneſſe, wherein it is deteſtable, and imployed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the due lucre of mans ſuſtenance, then it becomes tolerable: But if it bee referred to the neceſſarie lucre of mans health, then is it greatly commendable. If there can be then any commodity for mans health gathered out of urine, (as there may be much) men ſhould not be negligent in ſeeking of that thing which ſhould do good both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others? ſeeing the covetous are ſo diligent in ſeeking for that thing which ſhall profit neither themſelves nor others?</p>
                  <p>And the negligence is ſo much the greater, if men be more remiſſe in ſeeking after ſo neceſſary a thing in a matter ſo commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then the covetous in a bad thing.</p>
                  <p>But in as much as this thing (by reaſon it is not plainly ſer forth) is with no leſſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to be ſtudied on, then it is neceſſary to be uſed, the ignorant may have ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: I therefore in the name of many other, have taken this pains on me, to ſet forth this thing ſo plainly,<note place="margin">Ignorance ſet aſide.</note> that ignorance can have no excuſe.</p>
                  <p>But that no man ſhould doubt of the truth
<pb facs="tcp:37337:5"/>of this Treatiſe, or of mine intent,<note place="margin">Why this Book is written.</note> in putting forth the ſame rather in this our Engliſh tongue then any other: I ſhall briefly ſhew reaſons of both; Firſt, for the truth of it,<note place="margin">The firſt reaſon.</note> I will boldly ſpeak, knowing for certain that no man that can judge it, will ſay or thinke otherwiſe, but that it is as true as mans knowledge can deviſe it. And it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the moſt excellent writers of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick both Greeks and Latine; namely, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, Galen, Aetius, Aeginota, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thous, Theophilus, Actuarius:</hi> alſo <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Celſus Plinius, Conſtantinus, Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Clementius Clementinus,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more, conferring alſo with theſe <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenna, Egidius, Polidamus,</hi> and ſuch like: But with what temperance and moderation they that are learned may perceive. Theſe have I followed chiefly in this judgement of Urines.</p>
                  <p>And in the uſe of medicine and diſeaſes touching urine, I have joyned with them <hi>Dioſcorides, Quintus Serenus, Columela, Sextus Platonicus,</hi> and divers others. Now if there be any man that doubteth of the truth of thoſe writers in this thing, I am not here to force beleef upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The intent of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note>But now as touching mine intent in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Treatiſe in Engliſh; though this
<pb facs="tcp:37337:6"/>cauſe might ſeem ſufficient to ſatisfie many men, that I am an Engliſh man, and therefore may moſt eaſily and plainly write in my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tongue, rather then in any other: yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that know the hardneſs of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this anſwer ſhould ſeem unlikely: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that it is harder to tranſlate into ſuch a tongue, wherein the Art hath not been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before, then to write in thoſe tongues in which the terms of the Art are better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſhew briefly the cauſes moving me thereunto. I am ſure, there are but few that ever ſought counſell for their health, but they know that the common trade to attain to the knowledge of the diſeaſe, is by the judgement of the urine, though not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, yet as the principall.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, as the is not any thing ſo good, but the abuſe of it may cauſe harm to enſue therupon. So this judgment of urines, though it be a thing highly to be regarded, yet if it be uſed raſhly without foregoing ſigns it may cauſe (as it doth often) ſome error in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Phyſician, though he were right excellently learned: not ſo much by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Phyſitian, as by want of knowledge in the patient, which ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Phyſician, in ſuch queſtions as hee
<pb facs="tcp:37337:6"/>needed to demand of him: and not to look that the Phyſitian ſhould tell him all things at the firſt ſight, more like a God then man.</p>
                  <p>So that if there be any Phyſitian ſo arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, that he will take upon him to tell all things alone, and will not hear the Patient ſpeak, ſpecially not knowing the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither ſeeing other ſignes but only the urine, as I dare boldly pronounce, That ſuch a man is unworthy to be called a Phyſitian. So it ſhall be good for all men, not to truſt to the judgement of ſuch a one: for by ſuch miſ-uſe in this thing not only much harme befalls the patients, ſo that it hath been the occaſion of many mens death, but alſo very much reproach hath enſued to the whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and order of Phyſitians, and hath cauſed that excellent and moſt neceſſary art to bee contemned, derided, and little ſet by.</p>
                  <p>To avoid the more this inconvenience, I have written this little Treatiſe to all men in common,<note place="margin">The uſe of this Book.</note> that they may learn to have ſome knowledge in their own urines, and thereby may be the better able to inſtruct the Phyſitian, at the leaſt, what ſort of urine they have made from time to time from the beginning of their ſicknes, and ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>And alſo what fort of water they were
<pb facs="tcp:37337:7"/>ſoure, or bitter, and ſuch like. Yea beyond all this, he requireth in every man the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his own pulſe, which is a thing har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then the judgement of urines.</p>
                  <p>Now if you require Examples, the whole world is full of them. They that wrote in Greek,<note place="margin">Examples of Writers in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue.</note> wrote in their own vulgar tongue: and ſo did they that wrote in Latine, write in their own common ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that, have we not infinite exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Learned men in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which wrote of Phyſick in their own tongue? Yea, Is not our own <hi>England</hi> full of Examples? How many Books of Practiſes? how many Herbals? and other like Books of Phyſick, hath there been put forth many yeers paſt? And yet unto this day doe not learned wits ſleepe. How much is all <hi>England</hi> bound to that Worthy and Learned Knight Sir <hi>Thomas Eliot,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Thomas Eliots</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Health.</note> which took the pains to build a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Health for all Engliſh men (beſides many other learned Books that he hath put forth in the Vulgar tongue) whereby a man may learn both to govern himſelf ſo, that though he eſcape not all ſickneſſes quite, yet he ſhall eſchew the great dangers of them? <hi>England</hi> may rejoyce of ſuch a Knight: yea, <hi>England</hi> hath too few that

                  <p>Now will I leave this and draw nearer to my purpoſe, and will deſire all men that ſhall read this Book, patiently to bear with my boldneſs, and thankfully to receive my good minde. And if there ſhall bee found in this Book, or in any other that I ſhall put forth, a ſmall error or overſight (for greater errors, I dare ſay there ſhall be none) I ſhall deſire all them that ſhall find any, to advertiſe me thereof by word or writing, and I ſhall be ready not onely to render condign thanks, but alſo to amend duely that ſhall be thought amiſſe, or elſe to yeeld a reaſon for the proof of the ſame,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Reader.</note>And now to make an end: I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire every man ſoberly and diſcreetly to uſe this my Book, not uſing it to the taunting or checking of other men: nor to truſt in their own knowledge further then they ought.</p>
                  <p>And likewiſe I ſhall exhort all men, not to mock and jeſt with any Phyſitian (as ſome light wits do) tempting them with
<pb facs="tcp:37337:8"/>Beans ſtale, in ſtead of mens urine: others bringing to them mens water for womens, and ſuch other like things. For in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they deceive not the Phyſitian, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For a mans water to be like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, it need ſeem no ſtrange thing. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, again there is a notable difference, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that that water which in a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth health, if it were a womans, might declare ſome diſeaſe; and likewiſe that which in a woman ſignifieth health, if it were a mans water, it might betoken ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And if a mans water and womans be like, and betoken both diſeaſes, thoſe diſeaſes may be divers and not one.</p>
                  <p>Yea two mens waters being both alike, ſhall not declare alwaies one grief, except they agree alſo in age, diet, exerciſe, and other like things</p>
                  <p>Alſo, that a Beaſts Water may be like a Mans (the Mans ſickneſſe being thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>Hypocrates</hi> witneſſeth, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth, as I ſhall declare hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if you ſeek the Patients health, look that you receive the urine diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and as ſoon as you can, preſent it to the Phyſitian, and be diligent to inſtruct him in all things that you can, and that
<pb facs="tcp:37337:8"/>he ſhall not have need to aske. And ſo no doubt, you ſhall receive great commodity of that Art, to the health of man, and the glory of God, which hath given ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge unto man.</p>

                     <p>AS unto them that are learned and know by the Art of Anatomy the ſcituation of the parts of man, and the naturall office
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37337:10"/>of every part, it is eaſie enough to perceive the originall generation and cauſe of urine, without any example: ſo unto them that neither know the ſcituation, nor offices, no, neither yet the names of the parts of mans body, it is ſcarce poſſible to make them to perceive the generation of urine, without ſome ſenſible example. But becauſe it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to find an artificiall example, which can alone duely expreſſe this work of nature, I will uſe therefore an example of a natural work, which ſhall expreſſe in many points this thing, though not in all; for ſuch can there none be, but the thing it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And in as much as this example is not eaſie to be underſtood of all men, though the moſt part do now a daies partly know it by experience of finding ſprings of waters, I will firſt propoſe an artificiall example, to make both the other to be the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note>It is daily ſeen in diſtilling of Waters, that the temperate heat of the fire doth ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the pureſt part of the juice from the herbs, and alſo from the groſſer juice. This by naturall lightneſs is drawn into the head of the Stillatorie, where by the coldneſs of the helmet, it is made ſomewhat groſſer, and ſo through naturall heat deſcendeth and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37337:11"/>paſſeth forth by the Pipe of the Stillato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note>And as the Art of man uſeth to make this water, ſo doth nature uſe to make the water of ſprings, whereof come all rivers, ſtreams and floods, except the ſea. For ſeeing the earth is not perfectly ſound and thick of ſubſtance,<note place="margin">Cauſe of ſprings.</note> as ſtones and ſome woods appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be, but it is hollow and full of holes, as you ſee that cork is: ſo that the air which by his ſubtleneſs pierceth into never ſo little a hole, entreth and filleth this hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nature ſo leading to it, becauſe no place ſhould be emptie: In which place by the coldneſs of the earth, the air is turned into water, as you may ſee in walls and pillars or ſtone, namely, of marble, how the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſtone turneth the air into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hangeth full of drops, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times trickle down apace, as if they did ſwear. So when the earth hath turned the air thus into water, then doth it drop down and gathereth together, and ſo run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth out as it can finde or prepare way. As long therefore as there is hollownes in that place, with ſuch ſort or coldneſſe, and none other let, the Spring of water ſhall never ceaſe. But if the way by any means be ſtopped, then the water turmoileth and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37337:11"/>laboureth, either to expell that let, or to make a new way.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The cauſes of diverſity in taſt of Water.</note>Now this water being thus ingendred
of the air which hath no taſte, is alſo naturally without all taſte: but the taſt that it hath is the taſte of the vaines of earth or mettall, by which it doth run. And that is the cauſe that ſome waters are ſweet, and ſome ſoure; ſome freſh, and ſome ſalt, and otherwiſe diverſly taſted; ſome alſo are hot, and ſome cold, and with other like qualities endued, according to the ground whereby it paſſeth. But of this I will not now ſpeak, becauſe I have appointed for it a peculiar Treatiſe, if God grant me time: Only this I ſay now, that a man that is expert, can by the colour, taſt, and other qualities of the water which he ſeeth, tell what vains of earth or mettals is in that place whence that water cometh, though he ſee it not.</p>
                     <p>And this water is expelled out of his firſt place, as unprofitable there to remain; and yet when it is come forth thence, it is good for divers and ſundry uſes.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of urine.</note>Thus may we thinke of the generation and uſe of urine or mans water.</p>
                     <p>Is ſhall not need that I here reckon exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the places, cauſes,<note place="margin">Three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions.</note> and the order of the three concoctions which go before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37337:12"/>of urine, but it ſhall ſuffice to tell briefly, that of the meat and drink together concocted in the ſtomack is made rude blood: (if I may ſo call it) which rude blood is wrought again, and made more perfecter in the liver: and thirdly yet more purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hollow vein, where the urine is ſeparate from it, as whey from milk, but yet may not exactly be called urine, till it come into the reins or kidnies, which draw it out of the hollow vein, by a certain naturall power reſting in them. And then doth the reins or kidnies alter it perfectly into urine, as the coldnes of the ground turneth air into water. But you muſt take this compariſon or ſimilitude to be ſpoken of the alteration it ſelf, and not of the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Now when Urine is thus made like to that faſhion of water (as I ſaid) then as the water paſſeth forth from his firſt place, by iſſues outward, ſo doth the urine deſcend from the reins by certain veins (as it were) called Water pipes, and runneth into the bladder, from whence at due times it is expelled forth, if the way be not let. So that you may compare the reins to the head of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit, the water pipes, to the conduit pipes, the bladder to the conduit, and the ſhaft to the rock of the conduit.</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37337:12"/>
                     <p>And further as the water doth declare by taſte and colour the qualities of the earth, or veins of mettall, whereby it runneth, and from whence it commeth, ſo the urine by colour, and other wayes, declareth of what ſort the places that it cometh thorow, and humors that it commeth from are affected.</p>
                     <p>And yet not only ſerveth for this, but alſo as the water, though it depart from the earth as ſuperfluous in that place, yet in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places and to other purpoſes it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable. So the urine, though it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled as a ſuperfluous excrement, yet beſide the commodity of judgement, which it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth of the parts that it cometh from, it doth alſo ſerve for divers uſes in medicine, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good commodities: Of both which, I will anon orderly write, after I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red certain things appertaining to the due judgement of it.</p>

And if that the Patient cannot well make it in the urinall, either by weakneſſe, or any other cauſe, then let them make it in another veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; but ſee that it be clean and dry; and as ſoon as the water is made, pour it forth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently into the Urinall altogether, and leave no part of it out, as ſome curious folk do uſe to put the clear part only into the urinall and caſt away the dregs, as though it ſtood not with their modeſty to bring ſuch foul gear to the Phyſitian, others of ſuch like foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh mind. Pour it therefore in wholly and let not the urinall ſtand open, namely in a duſty place, but ſtop it cloſe with a glove or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37337:14"/>other leather, and not with cloth, paper, nor hay, and let it be brought to the Phyſitian within ſix hours at the furtheſt, for after that time it cannot well be judged.</p>

                     <p>NOw leaving this as a brief inſtruction of the generation of the Water or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,<note place="margin">Four things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in Urine, <hi>viz.</hi> Subſtance, Colour, Quantitie, Contents.</note> and of the manner of receiving it in veſſels due, with time and place meet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it. I will particually declare how many things are to be conſidered in it, which are commonly named four, that is the Subſtance, the Colour, the Quantity, and the Contents;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37337:15"/>and the Savour thereto may be added as the fift; to the which fift, if you ſhall joyn ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and order, as two accidents common to the firſt four things, (but yet no leſſe to be conſidered then they) then ſhall you judge the more certainly.</p>
                     <p>Stablenes is called,<note place="margin">Stableneſs.</note> when the urine conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth certain daies together of one ſort. And if it alter every day,<note place="margin">Unſtable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Order.</note> then is that called
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtableneſs or changeableneſs, to which thing order doth appertain: For order is the following of one thing after another, as black coloured urine after white, green or pale. I mean not, becauſe that ſo it ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but only that you muſt obſerve how it doth follow. For black Urine doth not ſignifie the ſame if it follow after green urine, as it doth if it follow after white u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine: ſo that the order ought alſo to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
                     <p>But now to return to the four firſt things.</p>
                     <p>Subſtance is called in urine,<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note> the urine it ſelf, in reſpect of the thickneſs or thinneſs of it: So that there are 3.<note place="margin">Three ſorts of ſubſtance in urine.</note> ſorts of ſubſtance in urine: thick, thin, and mean.</p>
                     <p>Thin ſubſtance is called,<note place="margin">Thin.</note> when you may perceive well the joynts of your fingers through the urine.<note place="margin">Thick.</note> And contrariwiſe it is called thick, when you cannot well ſee your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37337:16"/>fingers through it: and that is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between extream thick and extream thin,<note place="margin">Mean Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</note> is called, mean,</p>
                     <p>Colours are divers, but the principall are theſe ſix, white, pale, flaxen, yellow, red, and black. And all the other colours are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under theſe ſix.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Light white as Chryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lſe, ſnowie.</note>As under white, ate contained clear as chryſtal, white as ſnow, and pure as water, which three are light whites.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Waterie. Dark white as milke-white, horny gray, pale, flaxen, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note>Then are there other three more darker, as milk white, cleer like horn, and grey.</p>
                     <p>After white, followeth pale colour, and then flaxen, after it followeth pale, and then yellow, which may be called golden, for it is the colour of pure gold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Light ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, ſaffron colour. Claret. Red. Crimſon. Purple. Blew.

                     <p>Then is there green of divers kinds, as light green, green as graſſe, ſtark green, and dark green.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo oil colours (that is popin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay green) of three ſorts: as of green, light oily,<note place="margin">Oylie.</note> ſtark oily, and dark oily.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Aſh colour.</note>After theſe is there Aſh colour like unto lead; and after it, as laſt of all cometh black. And theſe be the chief colours.<note place="margin">Black.</note>

                     <p>Now as touching quantity, it is alſo in three ſorts; much, little, and mean.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Quantity. Much.</note>Then it is called much quantity, when it exceedeth the meaſure of a mans drinking.</p>
                     <p>And then is it called little,<note place="margin">Little.</note> when a man piſſeth leſſe then he drinketh.</p>
                     <p>And that is mean,<note place="margin">Mean.</note> when a mans piſſing and his drinking is of like quantity. All this muſt be conſidered by due proportion.</p>
                     <p>The contents are all things in the water,<note place="margin">Contents.</note> that be of another matter and ſubſtance par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, then is the urine:<note place="margin">Sediment. Sublation. Cloud.</note> as the ſediment or ground, the ſublation or ſwim, and the cloud, To theſe are added other diſ-form contents, like hairs, like huskes, like bran, and ſuch other.<note place="margin">Crown.</note> And alſo the crown of the urine, with the bubles, and other things ſwimming on the top of it.</p>
                     <p>For the better underſtanding of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, you muſt note that the whole urine from the top to the bottome, is divided com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly into three rooms or regions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Four rooms or Regions. Ground or Sediment.</note>The lowermoſt is the region of the
ground or ſediment: ſo that the grounds or ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the contents that occupie the lowermoſt region. Or yet more properly, the ſediment is called a certain ſubſtance of groſſer matter then is the urine, like to a quantity of very watery flegm, which fleeteth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37337:17"/>a little above the bottome of the urine: But if it be ſo light, that it ſwim in the middle region of the urine, then is it called the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation or ſwim.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Sublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Swim.</note>And if it bee yet more lighter, ſo that it doth fleet in the higheſt part of the urine, then it is called a cloud: whereby you may perceive that the ground, the ſwim, and the cloud are but one thing in ſubſtance,<note place="margin">Cloud.</note> and differ onely by lightneſs and height, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his name according to the region that it occupieth. But yet again note, that every one of the 3.<note place="margin">Another diviſion of the three Regions.</note> regions, is farther devided
into other parts alſo; whereby you may know exactly, how far all contents differ from the juſt room of their region; ſo that the whole urine muſt be divided into eleven juſt parts, of which the nether region occupieth four, the fift is the void room between that and the middle region, which containeth 3. more, that is to ſay, the ſixt, ſeventh, and eight. And then the pinch is a void room between the middle region and the higheſt, which higheſt region, containeth the other two parts that remain, that is the tenth and the eleventh, as this Figure ſheweth which hereafter followeth.</p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:37337:17"/>
                     <p>ABove theſe 3. regions, about the very brink of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, you may ſee a certain ring as it were, going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and that is cal'd the crown.<note place="margin">Crown.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Higheſt of all things in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine are the bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go about with the ring only,<note place="margin">Bubbles.</note> or elſe fleet in the middle of the urine onely, or elſe both.

                     <p>NOW that you know the difference of ſuch things that ought to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37337:18"/>in urine, before you ſhal learn by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them, to judge of the perſon that made it, how he is diſpoſed in his body: you muſt firſt know how many waies the parts of the urine may bee changed in a healthfull man. For the better underſtanding of which thing, and of all that ſhall be ſaid hereafter, I will firſt define what a perfect whole urine is, which as, it betokeneth no grief in it ſelf, ſo it is a true, rule to examine all other urines by that, which are not whole, but declare in them ſome grief.</p>
                     <p>A perfect whole urine is mean in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and in quantity,<note place="margin">A perfect whole urine <hi>Galen c.</hi> 12. <hi>Criſib.</hi>

                     <p>So that this perfect whole urine declareth the difference of all other urines; For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry urine the more it agreeth with this, the better it is: and the more it differed from this, the worſe it is, as I ſhall anon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly declare.</p>
                     <p>And here you muſt mark, that this perfect whole urine is not only taken of a perfect whole man, but alſo of the luſtieſt time of mans age, that is at thirty yeers: or more largely, between twenty five and thirty five. For in every age doth the urine alter, as you ſhal hear by and by.</p>

For the more that the ſpring time draws toward heat the more the urine gathereth high colour,<note place="margin">Spring.</note> departing from pale and flaxen, toward pale and light ſaffron: and the inequality of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance changeth into a due equality according to nature, and the ground doth waxe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the quantity is more in reſpect to that is drunk: ſo that about the midſt of the ſpring they return to a mean.</p>

                        <hi>CH AP. VII.</hi> What be the generall qualities that alter the parts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</head>
                     <p>BEfore I treat of the ſignification of the parts of Urine, I think it good to inſtruct
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37337:22"/>you of the generall qualities which cauſe all alterations in urine: whereby you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not only what every urine doth beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (as I ſhall anon ſet forth) but alſo if you mark well this Chapter, you ſhall ſee the cauſe why every urine doth ſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall underſtand therefore, that there be four chief and only qualities, whereof all things that are both in the Sea and Earth are made: as man and beaſt, fiſh and fowl, trees, herbs, ſtones, and mettals. Theſe four qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are heat, cold, moiſtneſs and drineſs: and theſe four continuing duly tempered (as nature ordered them firſt in every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body) be the cauſe of continuall health. But if they bee altered wrongly, then doe they cauſe diſeaſes diverſly, according to the diverſitie of the alterations: And as they doe cauſe diſeaſes, ſo they change the colour, ſubſtance, and other parts of the urine, whereby wee may conjecture the cauſe of the diſeaſe; and ſo conſequently the diſeaſe it ſelf, though ſometime it declareth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe it ſelf, and not the cauſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>But now to come to the matter meeteſt for this time,<note place="margin">Paſſive and active qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</note> you ſhall mark that two of theſe four qualities are named Paſſive, and they cauſe but ſmall alteration in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37337:23"/>The other two are called Active, and they cauſe great alteration.</p>
                     <p>The Active qualities are heat and cold, and the Paſſive qualities are drineſs and moiſtneſs.</p>
                     <p>When Moiſtneſs therefore exceedeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,<note place="margin">Moiſtneſs.</note> it dulleth the naturall colour of urine, thicketh and ingroſſeth the ſubſtance, and increaſeth the quantitie. And as the over-part of it above waxeth rough and troubled, ſo the ground increaſeth and continueth raw and unconcoct.</p>
                     <p>But dryneſs doth diminiſh the quantity of urine,<note place="margin">Dryneſs.</note> and alſo the contents: It maketh it thin in ſubſtance, cleer and bright, and cauſeth mean colour, and the ground appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth groſſer.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe heat,<note place="margin">Heat.</note> if it exceed meaſure but little, it maketh pale and light ſaffron co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the urine. But if heat exceed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it cauſeth golden and ſaffron colour, with mean ſubſtance, and a little brightneſs; the ground is mean, in reſpect to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of urine, but it declineth from the due whiteneſs toward ſaffron colour.</p>
                     <p>But cold on the other ſide maketh urine turn to white colour,<note place="margin">Cold.</note> and changeth the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from a mean. And if the cold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the urine will alter from mean ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37337:23"/>and therefore conſequently will bee either thin or groſſe. If it be thin or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, the ground ſhall le either obſcure and little, or much, and that divers and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct.</p>
                     <p>And this is the working of theſe four qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities when they exceed alone.</p>
                     <p>But and it two of them exceed together, there may reſult of that ſort four other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperances; as hot and dry, hot and moiſt, cold and dry, and cold and moiſt.<note place="margin">Compound diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of qualities.</note> Now what alterations theſe and every one of them doth cauſe the urine, you may eaſily conjecture, if you keep in mind that which I ſaid of the four ſimple qualities, and ſo adde together the alterations.</p>
                     <p>And this muſt you remember therewith, that where they both agree in any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they cauſe that alteration to bee the greater: and where they be contrary, they cauſe the alteration to be nearer to a mean: howbeit ſomewhat to help you, take this brief declaration.</p>
                     <p>As a temperate man doth make that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect urine, written of before,<note place="margin">A tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man.</note> (<hi>in Chap.</hi> 6.) ſo the urine of a ſanguine man (which is hot and moiſt) ſhall be yellow, or light ſaffron coloured, by the reaſon of the heat, and ſomewhat groſs, by reaſon of the moiſture.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The ſignifications of the parts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine particularly.</head>
                     <p>I Told you in the ſixt Chapter of this Book what urine was moſt perfect, ſound, and healthfull of all other. And I ſaid, that it was the rule and tryall to examine all other urines by, ſo that the neerer that any urine was to it, the better it was; and the further that it declineth from it, the worſe it is. This I ſaid, ſhould be as a generall rule, which thing to be true in healthful men, you may perceive by that I have written already. And that it is alſo true in ſick men. <hi>Hypocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> witneſſeth, ſaying, <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine is beſt, whoſe ground is white, duly knit and ſtable, all the time that the ſickneſs prevaileth.</hi> But <hi>Galen</hi> to ſupply that that is underſtood in this ſaying, and ſo to make it perfect, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereto, <hi>That it muſt be of colour par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie golden or pale, and of a mean ſubſtance between thick and thin.</hi> And alſo in theſe things is required ſtableneſs, to make it a perfect Urine; for that which is untable in any part, in that it is not perfect.</p>
                     <p>Here were a place to ſpeake of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this changeableneſs or unſtableneſs;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37337:25"/>for there is one ſort called ordinary, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other called unordinarie, and of both theſe are there divers differences. But becauſe they depend of an exacter judgement then unlearned men can well attain unto, I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs them for this time, and will declare the other differences of urine, whereby it alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from this mean urine, in all parts parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Subſtance of urine.</note>And firſt will begin with the ſubſtance of urine, the which (as I ſaid, before) is of three kindes, thick, thin, and mean.</p>
                     <p>A mean urine is that, that is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between extream thick,<note place="margin">Mean.</note> and extream thin. And as it is mean between them in ſubſtance, ſo is it mean in ſignification, for it doth betoken (of it ſelf) only good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and health. But the other two beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken diſtemperance and default of concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that diverſly, according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the cauſes of them, as you ſhall now conſequently hear.</p>
                     <p>Fiſt to ſpeak of thin urine, either it doth ſtill ſo continue thin,<note place="margin">Thin urine.</note> as it was firſt made, or elſe it doth ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waxe thick and troubled. That that doth continue ſtill thin doth betoken lack of concoction, and ſo doth the other alſo; but yet this that continueth thin beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth more lack of conoction, for it betokeneth that nature hath not yet begun to concoct. And therefore is that water, a ſign of extream crudity or rawneſs in nature. But that that waxeth thick, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37337:25"/>it; beginneth to cool, though it betoken lack of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, yet doth it declare that nature hath begun to concoct alreadie, notwithſtanding it is an evill urine, for it ſignifieth that nature hath need not only of great ſtrength to perform that concoction which ſhe hath begun; but alſo that there is required long time to the performance of the ſame. For the which cauſe, <hi>Galeu</hi> calleth this, <hi>Of all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines the worſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus have you heard touching crudity and concoction, what thin urine doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, ſo that all thin urine betokeneth crudity. And beſide that doth further betoken (as witneſſeth <hi>Hypocrates</hi>) <hi>gatherings or apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumations ſtumations in the nether parts of the bodie,</hi> namely, <hi>if it continue ſo very long, and the patient eſcape death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thin and white.</note>Furthermore, if ſuch thin urine have with it a light whiteneſs, it is a very evill ſign. For if it be in a burning ague, it is a token of frenſines. But if the patient be franſick alreadie, and the urine doth ſo continue, it doth moſt commonly betoken death. And if the eſcape death (the which is ſeldome ſcen) then ſhall he be long ſick, and eſcape hardly.</p>
                     <p>Thin urine alſo betokeneth divers other things: as the ſtopping of the reins, and of the water veins. And likewiſe, if a man have had much bleeding, or laxe, or piſſing, his urine will be white and thin, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without ground: Like manner in old
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37337:26"/>age, and long weakneſs of ſickneſs. Alſo in young children if it continue long, it is a deadly ſign.</p>
                     <p>Yet thin urine doth ſometime betoken the end of ſickneſs and recovery of health: as in Agues (namely quotidians) if at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of them and ſo after, the urine did appear thick and troubled, and eſpecially if the colour amend therewith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thin and flaxen.</note>And if it be thin ſubſtance, and of flaxen colour, then is it better then thin and white: for becauſe the colour is better though the ſubſtance bee all one; ſo that though it betoken ſome weakneſs and lack of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, yet not ſo much as doth the other, for the colour is meanly concoct: that is to ſay, naturall heat is meanly increaſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thin and golden.</note>But if it be thin and golden, it is yet more better then thin and flaxen: for the colour is more exact and this betokeneth concoction half compleat, for that which it lacketh in ſubſtance, it hath in colour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thin and ſaffron.</note>After this is there thin and ſaffron colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which betokeneth firſt lack of concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and beſide that default of nouriſhment, as in a young man that faſteth long: And ſometime it betokeneth that exceſs of heat in the inner parts of the body, doth cauſe cholerick humours to abound, as in the fever
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37337:26"/>tertian. Beſide all this, it betokeneth thought, carefulneſs, and watching, and alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much labour, and taking of heat in the Sun.</p>
                     <p>And thus have you heard the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thin urine, both alone, and alſo with ſuch colours as it can be coupled.</p>
                     <p>Now ſhall you hear what thick urine doth betoken, both alone, and alſo with ſuch divers colours, as it may be coupled.</p>
                     <p>Thick urine (which is, ſo I mean, when it is firſt made) either it doth continue ſtill thick,<note place="margin">Thick.</note> or elſe it doth ſettle, and waxe clear. If it continue ſtill thick, it betokeneth that that diſturbance which was in the blond, that is to ſay, the rage of ſickneſſe doth ſtill continue ſtrongly: and that naturall ſtrength is but weak. This urine is not ſo good as that which doth ſettle and waxe cleer. For that doth betoken that the diſeaſe ſhal ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be overcome: howbeit there remaineth yet ſomewhat of that diſtemperate trouble in the blood: yet nature hath the over-hand and expelleth the matter of the grief, and therefore is ſuch a urine called good, but yet it betokeneth ſome lack of concoction, though not ſo much as that which continueth troubled and thick ſtill.</p>
                     <p>Alſo thick urine (if it be exceeding thick) doth betoken death, as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37337:27"/>And the urine that is thick and troubled, like beaſts urine, doth betoken head ach, either preſent already, or ſhortly after to come. If thick urine appeare in an ague, where thin urine went before, it betokeneth that the ſickneſs will abate ſtraight waies, for it declareth that nature hath overcome the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſickneſs: but if it appear thick at the beginning of the ague, and do not waxe thin in proceſs of time, it betokeneth plenty of matter, and weakneſs of nature; ſo that there is fear leſt nature ſhould be overcome, except the colour do amend.</p>
                     <p>Thick urine alſo, betokeneth openneſſe of the water pipes and reins.<note place="margin">Thick and white.</note> And if it bee thick and white, it betokeneth great plenty of raw humours and ſundry kinds of flegm to be gathered in the bodies: and betokeneth alſo (namely if it be much) that thoſe gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which might be looked for in ſore agues ſhall not enſue, for the matter which ſhould cauſe them deparreth out by urine: but the whiteneſs of this urine is bright as ſnow. For if it be ſomewhat darker like the whiteneſs of milk, it is a token of the ſtone, either in the bladder or reins, namely, if ſuch urine chance in the end and amending of ſickneſs.</p>
                     <p>But if the colour of it be grey, it betokeneth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37337:27"/>not only plenty of matter in the body, but alſo that the whole body is poſſeſſed with a dangerous ſickneſs, whereof oftentimes it chanceth the patient to break out with bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and heat in his skin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thick and claret.</note>Next after this followeth thick claret co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour (for flaxen, yellow, nor ſaffron colour doth not agree with thick urine) and it doth ſignifie that the diſeaſe ſhall continue long, ſpecially if the ground of it be alſo of claret colour. But yet this diſeaſe without perill of death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thick and red.</note>Thick urine, if it be red coloured, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token abundance of blood, as is ſeen in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Agues, and in all perillous Agues, as witneſſeth <hi>Theophylus.</hi> If this water come by little and little, it is an evill token, for it doth alwaies declare danger.</p>
                     <p>And if that ſort of urine (in ſuch Agues) do waxe trouble, ſo that there come with it deafneſs of hearing, and ach of the head, with pain in the neck and in the ſides of the belly, it betokeneth that the Patient ſhall have the falling evill within a ſeven night.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thick and crimſon.</note>And if a thick urine have a crimſon colour, If it bee burning Agues, and the Patient then have the headach, it betokeneth that a chief criticall ſign either is then preſent, or elſe night at hand.</p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:37337:28"/>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thick and blew.</note>But if the urine be thick and blew colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it ſignifieth diverſly, as the perſons are that made it. For in them that are in way of recovery, it betokeneth that the ſhall eſcape their grief. It ſignifieth alſo pain in the water-pipes, or elſe that the party hath runn much.</p>
                     <p>And if it appear ſuch in old men, and that continue long, it declareth not only that the bladder is infected with evill humours, but commonly alſo that he ſhall be rid of them. But if it come after the grief of the ſtone, it declareth that the grief ſhall be turned into the ſtrangurie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thick and green.</note>Thick urine and green, namely in Agues is a token of the yellow Jawnders, either preſent, or ready to come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thick and aſh colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>Thick urine and aſh coloured, if it appear in Agues and do not ſettle, it is a ſign of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, But in the burning Ague, it betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the ſtrangurie will come ſhortly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Thick and black.</note>But if a black colour appear in thick urine, it betokeneth ſometime well, as in the end of the Fever Quarten, and of melancholike madneſs, for it betokeneth that the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike matter, which cauſed the diſeaſes, doth avoid out.</p>
                     <p>But ſometimes it is an evill token, for it ſignifieth that either the blood is burned
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37337:28"/>through exceeding heat, or elſe that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat is clean quenched through deadly cold, and therefore is commonly called a deadly ſign, namely in ſharp Agues, if it have an evill ſavour. And ſo meaneth <hi>Galen,</hi> when he ſaith, that he marked, <hi>The thicker that a black water is, the worſe it is,</hi> and moreover, <hi>That he never ſaw any eſcape, which made ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus have you heard of the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thin and thick urine, with ſuch co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours as may be coupled therewith.</p>
                     <p>Now will I write a littler of the colours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and of ſuch tokens as come chiefly of them, rather then of the ſubſtance or any other part of the urine.</p>

                        <p>Now ſeeing this great Clerk and Father of Phyſick, doth thus eſteem the ground, it ſhall not ſeem unmeet, that I orderly doe write briefly of thoſe principall things that are to be conſidered, as touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; and firſt of all of the ground, which hath alteration (as you have heard) both in ſubſtance, colour, and quantitie.</p>
                        <p>But now as touching the ſubſtance? then is it only mean, when the third concoction in the veins is perfect. For the ground is the excrement (as you might ſay) of that third concoction, and is like in forme to matter, ſave that it is more duly knit together then is matter, and doth not ſmell ſo evill as it; or elſe you may liken it to thin fleam.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Groſſes ground.</note>This Ground is then groſs, when the veins are repleniſhed with raw humors, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this groſſeneſs or thickneſs is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes an evill token; for ſometime it is a ſign that nature hath prevailed againſt the crude humours which cauſed diſeaſes, and doth expell ſuch ſuperfluous excrements. And that ſhall you diſcerne by the goodneſs, of the colour, and alſo if it come in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37337:36"/>of the ſickneſs: for if it come at the beginning, either in the increaſe of the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then are they to be ſuſpected as evill; eſpecially if they bring with them evill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Thin ground.</note>A thin ground, being alſo pure, and ſo cleaving to the bottom of the Urinal, that it will not lightly riſe, though the urinall be ſhaked, it is a token of great weakneſs of nature in the third concoction, and ſuch a ground appeareth moſt in white and watrie urine. Howbeit ſometime a thin ground cometh by the reaſon that the raw humors are extenuate through naturall heat, which getting new ſtrength, doth extenuate and diſperſe all groſsneſs of raw humors within the veins. For the propertie of heat, is to knit and bind together thin things, and to extenuate and diſperſe groſſe and raw things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Colour of the ground.</note>Now as touching the colours of the ground, the perfect ground is neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding white, neither yet pale, but mean between both, for if there appear any ſuch exceſſive white, neither yet pale, but mean between both, for if there appear any ſuch exceſſive white, then is it ſome rag of phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick matter, or elſe matter extreamly concocted, which commeth from ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward member being ſore; and that you may diſcern (as I ſaid before) by the toughnes, and by the ſavour.</p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:37337:37"/>
                        <p>And if any man be deſirous to know the cauſe why the ground is white of colour, let him remember, that the ground is the ſuperfluous excrement of the bloud being perfectly concocted in the veins. Now that the bloud it ſelf, when it is exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, is turned into a white, or at leaſt, a party white colour, you may conjecture by the generation of milke, and alſo the ſeed of man, yea, and of matter, which all three are nothing elſe but bloud, exactly concocted, ſave that matter cometh of evill bloud.</p>
                        <p>And therefore whenſoever the ground hath in it any other colour then white, it is no good token: As firſt, if it be pale and flaxen coloured,<note place="margin">Pale, Flaxen.</note> then it is ſwarved from his right and commendable colour. Howbeit, yet it may be born as but meanly evill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that that colour commeth of ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of choler.</p>
                        <p>But if it be more higher coloured by cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, ſo that it be ſaffron coloured,<note place="margin">Saffron. <hi>Actuarius.</hi>
                           </note> then is it an evill token (as <hi>Actuarius</hi> ſaith) for it declareth that choler is exceſſively increaſed, either by the order of diet, or elſe by the corruption of bloud, or ſome other wayes. Howbeit <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſms,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">7. Aph. 32.</note> ſeemeth to ſay the contrary; for he ſaith, <hi>That when the ground is ſo colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37337:37"/>of choler, eſpecially if at the beginning of the ſickneſſe it were waterie to ſight, then doth it betoken a quicke ſickneſs;</hi> that is to ſay, as <hi>Philotheus</hi> expoundeth it,<note place="margin">Philotheus.</note> a ſickneſſe, that will ſhortly be ended, and ſo it may juſtly be called a good ſign. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding as in this point it is a good token, in that it ſignifieth that the diſeaſe is nigh the end, ſo it may be called (as <hi>Actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> calleth it) an evill ſign becauſe it doth betoken a cholerick ſickneſs, and that cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler doth unnaturally abound.</p>
                        <p>And if this anſwer do not content you, (though it content <hi>Antonius Muſa</hi>) than may you ſay more better (as I thinke) thus:<note place="margin">Antonius Muſa.</note> That if the ground be at the beginning of the ſickneſs coloured with choller, and ſo increaſe (as <hi>Actuarius</hi> ſeemeth to mean) then is it an evil token indeed, for it declareth both the abundance, and alſo the encreaſe of choler. But if the ground, at the beginning of a cholerick diſeaſe were watry, that is, white and thin, and afterward turn to ſaffron co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which is the exact colour of choler: or elſo to a yellow colour (which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſſe cholerick) then is it a token that the cholerick matter, which before lay lurking in the body, doth now begin to avoid; and ſo the cauſe of ſickneſſe,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37337:38"/>thus by nature expelled, health muſt needs follow.</p>
                        <p>As contrariwiſe, if after yellow or ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron colour it change unto whiter, and there be no certain token of concoction, then it is an evill ſign, and a token of phrenſie.

                        <p>Theſe colours come of a black melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humour, being ingendred within the veins, or elſe coming from ſome other part into them: or elſe it betokeneth deadly mortifying. But ſometimes it cometh of

                        <p>And now for a concluſion, whatſoever I have ſaid of the ground, you ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſame to bee ſpoken of the ſwim, and the cloud; for they are in kinde but one thing ſave that they differ in lightneſs and heft, and therefore alſo in places. But the judgement of their ſubſtance and colour, is much after one rate, though ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there be, as you ſhall hear hereafter.</p>
                        <p>And likewiſe of their quantity,<note place="margin">Quantitie</note> which as it is then only commendable when it is mean, ſo if it be greater then a mean, it doth declare ſome alteration in man, though not alwayes extreamly evill, for ſometime it is a token of fatting, or growing to a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs,<note place="margin">Great.</note> and that it doth ſignifie, if none other evill ſign be coupled with it. For though the perſon ſeed much on nouriſhing meats, and that with reſt and an idle life yet naturall heat appeareth ſo ſtrong, that ſhe can eaſily concoct ſuch meats. According to this ſaith <hi>Galen</hi> in his Judicials, that the plenty of the ground in urine betokeneth certain and exact with concoction: And that as the body is repleat with crude humours, ſo it declareth that thoſe ſame be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37337:39"/>in expelling out at that preſent time. And for this cauſe (ſaith he) in all children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, and in men alſo which feed much, or bee of ſome other cauſe replete with humors, their urine hath a great ground.</p>
                        <p>Alſo oftentimes it chanceth the pores of the skin to be ſtopped, ſo that inch excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as were wont to paſs out by them, are inforced to ſeek a new paſſage, which they find moſt readieſt by the urine, and thereof are the contents, and namely the ground, oftentimes encreaſed. And all theſe waies chance in health. But in ſickneſs, it chanceth many and groſſe ſuperfluities do appear in the urine, as often as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall powers, namely, the alterative or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctive power being weakned, ſuch crude humours paſs out undefied.</p>
                        <p>So doth it chance (as witneſſeth <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Trallianus</hi>) <hi>That the urine of them which have the Collick,</hi>

                           <hi>is flegmatick and hath a great ground.</hi> But if the contents be either great, or groſs in the beginning, or in the augmenting of ſickneſs, (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Patient have any notable Ague) it argueth abundance of humours, to the concoction of the which there needeth both ſtrength of naturall powers, with time and good ſpeed.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</note>And now contrary wayes muſt you judge of the ſmalneſs of the contents, for they be cauſed either of great labour, long faſting, ſtopping, or obſtruction of the veins, and ſuch like parts, or elſe of ſlackneſſe of concoction.

                           </note> then is the ground great, but if the body be repleniſhed with cholerick humors, then is there in the urine either little ground or none at all; but in ſuch caſe it is well, if there be any ſublimation or ſwim.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Urine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground.</note>Now ſeemeth the place moſt meet to ſpeak of ſuch urines as have no ground at all, nor other orderly content, and that will I doe by the order of the colours of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, according as <hi>Actuarius</hi> proceedeth.</p>
                        <p>The urine that is very white, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thin, and ſo lacketh the ground, doth betoken either ſome notable obſtruction, either immoderate cold, or elſe cruditie and lack of concoction. And as theſe tokens may be greater or leſſer, ſo ſhall the things which they betoken bee judged in like rate, either more, or leſſer.</p>
                        <p>But if the urine bee pale coloured, or flax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and then lacketh contents, as it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare leſſer obſtruction, ſo it doth ſignifie as great cruditie, as the other before.</p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:37337:40"/>
                        <p>And ſo ſhall you judge of urine that is yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or flaxen coloured. For in them it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that naturall heat doth prevail. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch things (I mean the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of the ground with thoſe colours) may chance (as often they doe) through vehement pain, immoderate labour, long watching, and alſo default of matter.</p>
                        <p>But ſuch urines as be higher coloured then theſe that I have named, by their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours they declare the qualities of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which doc prevail: and alſo betoken a certain putrefaction, and cruditie in the veins.</p>
                        <p>It chanceth alſo ſometimes, that ſome ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſore being in ſome of the principall members, by his unnaturall heat withdraw thither the matter (even as it were by cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping) and ſo doth cauſe the urine to have no ground. And though, indeed, it is never a good token to lack the ground in a urine, yet it is leſſe to be complained of, if the colour and ſubſtance draw nigh to a mean; for in ſuch a caſe it betokeneth, that though nature be ſomewhat ſlack, yet will ſhee ſhortly gather ſtrength, ſo that there ſhall appear a ground in the urine.</p>
                        <p>Now to ſhew you the reaſon, why it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth no ground to appear in the urine: Firſt,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37337:41"/>in caſe of cruditie, when there wanteth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect concoction, there muſt needs want al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the contents in the urine; for they are the excrements (as you might ſay) and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of the third concoction. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe though concoction be perfect enough, yet may there want the contents, if there be any notable obſtruction or ſtopping of the veins, namely, ſeeing the contents are ſomewhat groſs of ſubſtance, and therefore unable to paſs, if the way be any thing ſtopt.</p>
                        <p>After the ſame ſort ſhall you judge of long faſting and default of meat, and moreover of ſuch meats as are unapt to concoct. For in all ſuch caſes, there can be ingendred few or no contents.</p>
                        <p>And contrariwiſe, though nature doe work many ſuperfluities, yet if the wombe be ſo looſe that it yeeldeth many ſeges, then as the urine ſhall be the leſſer, ſo ſhall the contents be few or none: for nature then doth expel by ſege, thoſe ſuperfluities, which ſhould cauſe the contents.</p>
                        <p>And likewiſe, when there is in any part of the bodie an inflammation or exceſſive heat, which doth draw matter to it, either that any of thoſe parts are weak, unto which nature is wont to expell ſuch ſuperfluities; for in all ſuch caſes there may want the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37337:41"/>ground, and the other contents in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. And as for ſome of them (I mean crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and opilation) they may be well enough born withal, unles their continuance be long.</p>
                        <p>But now again, there is great difference touching the time of the ſickneſs in which it chanceth, for in the beginning and increaſe of ſharp Agues, if the ground be lacking, it betokeneth great weakneſſe of naturall ſtrength, which if not prevented, may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue unto the chief ſtrength of the ſickneſſe. And after ſuch an urine, there doth follow much waking and diſquietneſs, halfe mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and trouble of mind, and all thoſe ſhall bee according to the greatneſs of the Ague, either extream or mild. And ſometime it is a token that there ſhall bee a gathering ſore in ſome part of the body, namely, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreeable cauſes come therewith, as a winterly diſpoſition of the aire, with an uncertain ſtate of ſickneſs, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant alteration, and mean weakneſs of the Patients power. But in the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſickneſs, ſuch urine ought not greatly to be blamed, for then hath nature eſcaped the brunt of ſickneſs, though ſhe be yet weak. Yea, and in the chief ſtrength of ſicknes (as well as in the declination) it may ſeem no orange thing, if nature (as though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37337:42"/>ſhe had the over-hand) do gather her power together, and draw a little nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her ſelf, and thereby cauſeth little or no ground to appear. But afterward when ſhee is ſomewhat refreſhed, and doth more liberally nouriſh the body, then doth ſhee ſhew forth contents in the urine. And light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the order of the contents is ſuch, that firſt there appeareth a cloud, which afterward doth gather wore ſtrong and weightie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and doth become a ſwim or ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And laſt of all, when it hath gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a right naturall whitneſs, and due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then will it grow to a ground.</p>

                     <p>OTher things ſhould I here ſpeak of, as touching the Judiciall of the contents, both of their ſtableneſs, that is, their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in good form, and of their due knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, being neither tittered, nor diſperſed, nor yet overmuch clodded together. But becauſe the exact judgement thereof exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the capacitie of mean wits (for whoſe ſake I have written this Book) and cannot lightly be perceived of them, but by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37337:42"/>of a lively voice, I wil for this time overpaſs the exact and perfect declaration of them reſerving it to a place more due: And now will I briefly over-run the other things which remain to bee conſidered in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, but yet not without ſome mention of thoſe other, as occaſion commeth: and firſt thoſe difform Contents which occupie the place of the ground,<note place="margin">Difform contents.</note> and therefore take his name alſo.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſort there are four principall: the firſt is in bigneſs of a ſmall fatch, and red coloured, which you may call therefore red fatches, becauſe of their likeneſs. Theſe (as witneſſeth <hi>Galen</hi>) <hi>are ingendred of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and waſting of the fleſh when the fatneſs is already melted away.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Red fatches 6. Epid.</note> But in this there is great difference, for ſometime it is only the waſting of the reins, and ſometime of the whole body: as if there appear in the urine tokens of due concoction, then is that waſt in the reins onely. But if there appear in the urine default of concoction, (namely being great) or if the patient have an Ague, then is it the waſt of the whole body, and that ſtandeth well with reaſon, that when it betokeneth the waſt of the whole body, there muſt needs appear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of concoction; for in ſuch caſe thoſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37337:43"/>parts which are the Inſtruments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction are ſo weakned, that they cannot do their office. Theſe contents, by reaſon that they are groſs and heavie, therefore they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear alwaies in the bottom of the urinall.</p>
                     <p>Other difform contents there be alſo, of which ſome are like bran,<note place="margin">Brannie contents.</note> and ſome like ſcales. And of thoſe that are like bran, there is one ſort ſmaller, and another groſſer; the ſmaller ſort is like the bran of Wheat that is finely ground, and thoſe may I call fine bran. The groſſer is like bran of Barley, or of evill ground wheat, and may therefore be called groſs bran,<note place="margin">Fine bran. Groſs bran.</note> for it is thrice as big as the other.</p>
                     <p>The third ſort which is like Scales,<note place="margin">Scales.</note> hath no notable thickneſſe, but onely breadth and length. Theſe three doe betoken waſte of the ſtrongeſt parts of the bodie; but yet not all alike, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth declare in the ſecond Book of his Prognoſticks. Howbeit, becauſe that place of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is ſo difficult, that ſcarcely the great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men can agree thereon, I will not now meddle therewith, but will write <hi>Actuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> mind of thoſe three.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When the Ague</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is grounded in the bottome of the veins, then there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſuch fine bran.</hi>

But when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the whole body, this is the cauſe thereof; The Ague getting power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing unto the hard parts of the body (as in thoſe Agues which are called Fevers hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike) then in the ſtriving between thoſe parts and the Ague, the Ague having the maſterie, doth by his violence raiſe of ſuch brannie ſcurffe. For the nature of fire (whoſe operation the Ague hath) is to work accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the matter is that it findeth, either to melt it, if it be a liquid and unctuous thing, either elſe to ſcale it and fret it, if it be hard and unpliant: and the harder that the matter is, the greater ſcales it fretteth off; which thing you may ſee by daily experience, how fire melteth wax and tallow, and ſuch like, turning them into liquids: whereas of iron and of ocher metals,<note place="margin">Scales.</note> it maketh ſcales and not liquor.</p>
                     <p>But when the Ague hath attained and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſet, not onely the ſubſtance of the veins, but alſo the ſtrong parts of the body, and doth melt and waſte them, then doth there appear in the urine, ſcales, broad
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37337:44"/>and thin, which you ſhall know to come of the whole body (as I ſaid of the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) if the Pacient have an Ague, or there appear default of concoction in the urine: elſe if theſe two be abſent, it may come of the bliſtering of the bladder, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writeth 4. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 81. and namely, if there be in the urine an evill ſavour withall.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſpeak of the great and groſſe bran,<note place="margin">Groſs bran.</note> which as it is much greater then the other, ſo doth it declare a greater ſtrength or the Ague, and that in the whole body, and all the parts of it, enflaming and burning the whole ſubſtance thereof, and therefore is it not only the worſt of them all, but is nigh unto a deadly ſign,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and that either by the waſte and conſuming of the great and ſtrongeſt parts of the body, or elſe by the burning or drying up of the bloud. Which two things you may diſcern aſunder by the colour of them. For if they be red, then come they of the burning of the bloud; but if they be white, then come they of the waſt of the ſtrongeſt parts of the body.</p>
                     <p>Of this kind of contents ſpeaketh <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſaying:<note place="margin">

                        <hi>In whatſoever Agues there doth appear grounds like unto groſſe bran, it is a token that the ſickneſs ſhall continue long.</hi> Which ſaying, <hi>Galen</hi> doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37337:44"/>ſo to be true, <hi>If the Patient have ſufficient ſtrength to continue with ſuch ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, elſe it may be a ſign rather of ſhort life, then of long ſickneſs.</hi> For as that token is commonly deadly, ſo thoſe few that doe eſcape, do recover hardly, and not without the long ſufferance of the violence of that cruell Ague.</p>
                     <p>Now as touching the foreknowledge of it, whether the patient may endure with it or no, that ſhall you gather of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, order, and ſtableneſs or unſtableneſs of it. For if they be many in number, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to worſe and worſe, then it is an evill and mortall ſign, and doth declare that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is wearied and doth quite faint thorow the waſte and decay of the whole conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body: But contrariwiſe, if they appear few, and do alter continually unto leſſe evill tokens, then is there good hope of health. And this ſhall ſuffice as touching theſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Ragged ſcraps.</note>Now to ſpeak of the reſt, of the ragged ſcraps, hairs, and other like: Firſt you ſhall underſtand, that ſometime a good ground is coupled with certain evill and unconcted fragments of' all ſorts of humours, for ſometime there appeareth with the contents certain ragged ſcraps, enclining
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37337:45"/>in colour toward a yellow, or a white, or elſe ſome ſuch like, if thoſe appear in great quantitie, they declare the matter to be half unconcoct, and that the humour (whoſe ſcraps they are) doth abound in the depth of the body, and is as duſt or burned, but if they bee few, then declare they the malice of the humour to be milder, and that the uſe of evill meats doth cauſe them, the greater that ſuch ragged ſcraps are, the leſſer aduſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humours they declare to be in the veins, and the leſſer they be, the greater heat they do betoken. For the cauſe of ſuch ragged ſcraps is exceſſive heat, which doth turn thoſe humors into a thickneſs, and as it were a bony nature, by reaſon that they have remained long in certain veins, and were neither diſſolved, nor extenuated, nor yet quickly expelled by urine.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe there are hairs of ſundry lengths,<note place="margin">Hairs.</note> ſome an inch, and ſome an handfull long, ſome longer, and ſome ſhorter; and theſe are in colour whitely, and do betoken grief of the reins. Theſe are ingendred in the water-pipes, which go from the reins to the bladder, ſo that as long as thoſe water-pipes are in length, ſo long may thoſe hairs alſo be, which are a groſs and baked humor, wrought in form of a hair.</p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:37337:45"/>
                     <p>Of thoſe ſpeaketh <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſaying;<note place="margin">4. Aph. 76.</note> 
                        <hi>In whoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine ſoever there doth appear little peeces of fleſh, either as it were hairs, thoſe ſame come from the reins, namely, if the urine be thick.</hi> Howbeit theſe are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen in ſuch mens urines as feel no grief in the reines, but only have fed ſome continuing ſpace on flegmatick meats, which will prepare matter to ſuch diſeaſes, as they do alſo to many other griefs, of which to ſpeak in this place it is meet.</p>
                     <p>But to go on with this thing that wee have in hand, beſide ſuch ragged ſcraps and hairs (as I have ſpoken of) there appear ſometimes in the ground of the urine, and alſo diſ-parkled abroad in the urine it felf, ſundry and divers kinds of motes (as it were) which do declare that there is grief diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſundry parts of the body.<note place="margin">Motes.</note>

                     <p>And this now may ſuffice, as touching contents of every kind: Therefore now will I a little repeat out of <hi>Actuarius</hi> of the diverſitie of judgement,<note place="margin">The places of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. The loweſt region.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>That ground which fleeteth nigh to the bottom of the urinall, being in other points alſo good and mild, doth betoken no ſtrange thing. But if it be unconcoct and deformed, it betokeneth default in nature, And if his

But as it is commendable that the ground fleet nigh the bottome of the urinall, ſo is it diſcommendable if it lye flat on the bottome of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The middle region.</note>Now as touching the ſwim or ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it be good in colour and other waies, then doth it differ only in place from a right ground: and that cometh of an unnaturall windineſs, which maketh it to be ſo light, and to fleet above his due place, but if his colour and other like points bee evill, yet then doth it betoken leſſe evill, then if it were in the right place of the ground.</p>

But this difference is there in the clouds, the better that they be in colour and ſubſtance, the farther they differ from a right good and naturall Content. And therefore need they long time to return thereunto. And contrary wayes, the worſe that they are in colour and ſubſtance, the leſs they are to be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37337:46"/>blamed, by reaſon of their place, which is ſo much diſtant from the naturall place of Contents. For this is a generall rule: The lower that good contents fleet in the urine, (excepting alwaies ſuch as cleave to the had bottom) the better they are. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wayes of evill contents and ſuch like, the higher they fleet, the leſſe evill they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the regions, to the parts of man.</note>Now to make an end of this. You ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a certain proportion that is between the parts of the urine, and the parts of mans body. The higheſt part of the urine doth betoken, the higheſt part of the body, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the head, and ſuch other neer unto it. The middle region of the urine doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the middle parts of man, as the breaſt, the bowels, and the parts about them. The nether region of the urine doth purport the loweſt parts of man, from the bowels downward. And if you mark well this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, you may the eaſier judge the griefs of the parts of man.</p>
                     <p>For when the contents which in colour and ſubſtance are naturall, and yet by the abundance of windineſs be lift up to the higher part of the urine, it declareth ſome great pain to be in the head. And in like manner, when the ſwim or ſublimation
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37337:47"/>doth declare grief, that grief muſt be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in the middlemoſt parts of man (as I ſaid before) and ſo of the other.</p>
                     <p>A gain, as this proportion between the regions of urine, and the parts of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth declare that place in certain height, ſo doth it in breadth alſo by like proportion, if you doe duly mark the ſide, unto which the contents do decline.</p>
                     <p>And if you mark wel what I have ſaid, you may perceive the only cauſe of moſt ſuch griefs, when the contents is only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered in place, cometh of an unnaturall windines, but yet commonly annexed with phlegmatick and unconcocted matter.</p>
                     <p>And as the windineſs doth cauſe diſorder in the contents, ſo it cauſeth alſo another kind of things not to be neglected in urine, and that is bubbles:<note place="margin">Bubbles.</note> which ſometimes flote in the ring or garland onely, and ſometimes in the middeſt of the urine onely, and other times doe cover the whole face of the urine.</p>
                     <p>The Bubbles which ſtand round about over the garland only, and continue without parting, if they be of the ſame colour that the urine is, they declare great pain co be in the head, and that in all parts of the head, if the Bubbles joyn together without part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But and if they occupie only the one
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37337:47"/>half of the garland, then is that pain in the one half of the head. And ſo forth may you judge by like proportion.</p>
                     <p>But if they doe part in ſundry places, and joyn not all together, it is a token that the pain is the leſſer, and cometh of a weaker cauſe. The more yellower that their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is, the greater they declare the pain in the head to be. If they be white, or rather whitiſh, and ſtand about in the compaſſe of the garland, they betoken little pain or none. And if the urine bee thin withall, they betoken weakneſs of naturall heat, or elſe the opilation and ſtopping of the reins, namely, if there appear no ground in the urine. This doth <hi>Hippocrates</hi> witneſs, ſaying;<note place="margin">7. Aph. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>When in the urine there swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth bubbles, they betoken grief in the reins:</hi> And alſo that it ſhall long continue. The reaſon of the long continuance (as <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Philotheus</hi> doe both declare) is, becauſe that the grief commeth of cold and tough phlegmatick matter, which always is long before it may overcome. <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">Lib. 28. c. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>that that urine is evil, which is ful of bubbles and thick,</hi> in which if the ground be white, it is a token that there ſhal be grief either about the joynts, or elſe about the bowels. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, yet ſometimes the bubbles are not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37337:48"/>an evill token, but contrariwiſe, a good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of concoction, and declare that nature doth now apply her ſelf wholy unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. And this do the Bubbles ſignifie, when they appear in the water, in which they were not ſeen long before And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in an Ague, we may conjecture the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of it, when we ſee bubbles to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear after that ſort; except it be ſo that they appeared in the urine at the beginning of the ſickneſs, and hath ſo continued ſtill: For then they declare grievous pain to be in the head, yea and that dangerous, if the urine alſo be thin in ſubſtance. But if the ſubſtance of the urine be thick, then the bubbles are not ſo evill a ſign, neither declare ſo greivous danger.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes in ſtead of Bubbles which doe not appear when they ſhould, it ſufficeth that there appear a groſs ſome (as it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen to riſe upon wine) and it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token even the ſame thing that the Bubbles do,<note place="margin">Tome.</note> eſpecially in the declination of the Ague, of which I ſpake a little before.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Bubbles do appear very thick about the garland, in the urine of him that hath the iſſue of ſeed, or waſt of nature. Sometime alſo there are ſeen in the Bubbles certain ſmall ſcrapps (as you would ſay) much like
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37337:48"/>hairs in groſsneſs, and ſo ſuch length ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that they reach from the one ſide of the bubble unto the other, and ſometimes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſometimes ſhorter, which things may come either of the waſting of the reins, or elſe of the ſhedding of nature.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of the generation of bubbles, and alſo of the diſperſing and elevation of the contents, is an unnaturall windineſs. Of which, as there are divers kindes much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering aſunder, partly in multitude, partly in ſubſtance, and partly alſo in quality, ſo doth the bubbles engendred of them diverſly varie, according unto thoſe differences, whether they be ſole and ſeverall, or joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many knit together. But windineſs if it be groſſe, then doth it puffe up ſuch Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and if it be ſubtile, then doth it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work a diſperſion in the contents, and is not able nor meet to cauſe Bubbles. And hereby may you know the qualitie of the windineſs, and likewiſe alſo the quantitie. For there appeareth leſſe quantitie of windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to bee where the contents onely are diſperſed, then where ſuch Bubbles be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred.</p>
                     <p>Now as touching the other qualities of it, as heat and cold (which are the chief quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties indeed, and molt active) you may judge
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37337:49"/>them by the colour of the bubbles. For as pale colour, and other low colours declare coldnes of that windineſs, ſo high colours enclining toward yellow or higher, be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tokens of heat.</p>
                     <p>Bubbles that are ſmall, and thick knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the garland or the urine, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token a groſſe windineſs, whoſe cauſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be vanquiſhed; for the groſsneſs and toughneſſe that is in them, will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to ſwell great, and that cauſeth them to be ſo ſmall. And contrariwiſe, the greater that the bubbles be, and the more bouled, the more they declare that windines that cauſeth them to be ſevered from tough matter. Moreover, the colder that ſuch windineſs is, the leſſer grief is felt of them,</p>
                     <p>Bubbles in the urine of old men, namely being great and large, doe betoken cold win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, but ſometime ſuch bubbles are a ſign of rheum diſtilling from the head into the lights, eſpecially if the Patient at the entring of Summer were very hot, and ſo did drink much, which matter, the head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dryed, did draw unto him, and did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill again part of it down into the lights, whereof commeth a cough, and part of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the womb, which thereby is moved to laxe.</p>

                     <p>AS I have compendiouſly, and yet not very ſlightly ſpoken of thoſe former parts to bee conſidered in urine, ſo will I briefly ſpeak of a few more, which may not well be omitted, and ſo make an end of the Judiciall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note>Firſt, therefore in the over-part of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, round about the edge of the urine there appeareth a garland, circle, or ring, which doth there appear, by reaſon that the higher part of the urine being thinner than the reſt, and more ſubtiller, and therefore doth not only more ſooner alter, but doth more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er declare the alteration. Howbeit ſometime there doth appear no ring at all; and that is when the colour of the urine, and of it is all one, by reaſon of the great force of the cauſe which altereth the urine, but yet ſo that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth match that humour, and is neither overcome by it, neither yet hath overcome it. For if nature have plainly either got the victorie, or loſt it, then is there another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the garland, then is in the reſt of the urine.</p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:37337:50"/>
                     <p>Now if the colour of the urine be evill, and the colour of the garland better, it is a token of health. As if the colour of the urine bee yellow, red, or crimſon, or any ſuch like, and the colour of the garland be white, or whitely, it is a token full of good hope; but when the colour of the whole u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, is evill, and the colour of the garland worſer yet, then is it an evill ſign. As when the colour of the urine is green or purple, and the garland worſe coloured, then is it a plain token that nature is overcome, and that the evill humours have gotten the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe more particularly doth <hi>Egidius</hi> treat, but yet not more truly nor more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, his words are theſe: <hi>If the circle of the urine be thick and waterie, it is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that the hinder part of the head is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with phlegmatick matter; but if it be purple-coloured and thick, then is the forepart of the head overcharged with blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A pale and a thin circle declareth the left ſide of the head to be troubled with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy matter; but if it be red and thin, it betokeneth choler to abound in the right part of the head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Leddy or aſh-colour.</note>A Leadie or Aſh coloured circle, doth ſignifie the falling Evill, through the great grief of the brain.</p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:37337:50"/>
                     <p>And further declareth that ſuch grief ſhall proceed by the ſinnews into the other parts of the body. But if after ſuch a leadie colour there follow a reddſh colour, that is a good token; for then doth nature gather ſtrength again, and the powers of the brain reviveth.</p>
                     <p>If the colour of the garland be green,<note place="margin">Green.</note> and the Patient have a burning Ague, it is to be feared, leaſt that the abundance of choler ſhall cauſe a Phrenſie.</p>
                     <p>Black colour in the circle doth ſometime betoken mortification,<note place="margin">Black.</note> and ſometime only extream heat. But theſe ſhall you diſtinct (as I ſaid before of the urine it ſelf) by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the colours. For if green colour went before, then doth the black betoken aduſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through heat, but if his colour laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was aſh-colour, then is it a token of death, comming through the dominion of cold. And thus much as touching the colours may ſuffice for this time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Quivering in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note>Sometimes alſo you ſhall perceive a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and trembling in the garland, and that declareth grief in the back-bone. And thus many tokens be taken of the circle or garland.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes there will appear fleeting on the urine, certaine ſcum or fattineſs,<note place="margin">Fattineſs.</note> ſometimes like drops of oyle, and ſometime
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37337:51"/>like a thin ſpiders web, and theſe both doe betoken the melting of the fat within the body, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> witneſſeth in his Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks,<note place="margin">7 Aph. 30.</note> howbeit in his <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> he doth aſſign it as a token of the grief of the reins peculiarly, ſaying; <hi>In whole urine there fleeteth fattineſs, and that much at once, they have pain in the reins, but ſhall not long endure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> doth <hi>Galen</hi> underſtand ſo to be true, if that fattineſs appear quickly and much at once; elſe if it come by little and little with longer continuance, ſo doth it not betoken waſt only of the fat about the reins, but rather throughout the whole body, which ſign yet is not alway evil, except it continue long; for if it continue but a little while, it declareth no great evill.</p>
                     <p>Now to goe forth with other ſigns; If the urine have a ſtinking ſavour,<note place="margin">Stinking ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</note> it is ever an evill ſign, for it doth betoken ſome putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction more or leſſe; as of the bladder one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by ſome bliſter or ſore in it: and that moſt certainly, when the ſtinch is very great, and there appeareth alſo ſcales in the urine, and matter. But if there be matter in the urine, and the ſtinking ſavour but mean, then doth it declare the ſore to be in ſome other part of the body. But this ever is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37337:51"/>true, that matter in urine is a token of a ſore. And if in continuance of time the matter and ſtinch doe abate, it is a good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but if the other continue or increaſe, it is an evill ſign. If the urine doe ſtinke, and there appear no matter in it, then is it a token of ſome mortifying. For if there be in the urine mean tokens of concoction, then is the mortification in ſome one part of the body; but if the other ſigns in the urine be evill, then is that mortification rather of the whole body, then of any one part of it.</p>
                     <p>And thus have I over-run briefly the chief things to be conſidered in urine, which (I ſay) are appertaining or annexed to the urine it ſelf. Howbeit two other things there are, which though they be more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then theſe other, yet may they be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed no more then the other: that is to ſay, blood coming forth with the urine, and gravell expelled there with alſo.</p>
                     <p>Blood coming forth with urine,<note place="margin">Blood.</note> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſome ſore to be in the reins or blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writeth in his <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms</hi>) or elſe ſome vein to be broken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reins, namely if it come ſuddenly, and without manifeſt cauſe. Howbeit as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Oribaſius,</hi> and divers others do declare, and reaſon alſo with experience doth conſent,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37337:52"/>there may appear blood in the urine alſo, if that there be ſuch a ſore in the liver, or in the ſhaft. But in any of theſe caſes, the pain felt in the place and part, will utter from whence the blood commeth.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſpeak of gravell: <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Gravell.</note> 
                        <hi>In whoſe urine there appeareth gravel in the bottome, they have the ſtone in the bladder, or elſe in the reins,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; but commonly if the ſtone be in the reins, the gravell will be red, as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> declareth in his ſixt Book of his <hi>Epidemies,</hi> And thus now will I make an end of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial of urine.</p>

                     <p>THe greateſt commodity of urine is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared: that is, That it doth declare unto man, the manifold diſeaſes which happen unto him; and thereby doth not only give him knowledge of the cauſe, and ſo conſequently of the cure of the ſame, but alſo warneth him before of the grief to come, whereby he may take an occaſion to eſchew it, if he will be diligent.</p>

                     <p>Now as this is the greateſt commoditie of urin, ſo it hath many other as well in uſe of medicine as other waies, of which I will write ſome, though not all. And firſt out of <hi>Plinie,</hi>

                           <note place="margin">Milk white.</note>Milk white, by the name of it ſelf doth ſufficiently declare what it is; for it is the very colour of milk, though the ſubſtance need not to be ſo thick in the urine, as in the milk, for the colour muſt be underſtood ſeveral from the ſubſtance, both in this and all other colours, which thing would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, for it might elſe (as it hath often done) deceive the ſimple folk.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Horn white.</note>Horn white in like manner hath his name of the thing that it aſſimuleth moſt, for it is like the white and cleer part of a horn of a lanthorn, or ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>Grey is like the white part of a mans nail next unto the joynt,<note place="margin">Grey.</note> or like hoar hair that is not very white, for gray is ſo much darker then horn white, as horn white is darker then milk white.</p>

                        <p>Pale colour hath a certain appearance of yellow in it,<note place="margin">Pale.</note> but is exceeding little. If you ſeeth a peece of the rind of Pomegranate, and then put to it thrice as much clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will be a pale colour.</p>
                        <p>But if you put thereto little or no clean water, it will be flaxen coloured,<note place="margin">Flaxen.</note> that is ſomewhat more yellower then pale.</p>
                        <p>After it followeth pale,<note place="margin">Pale.</note> which is a kind of light yellow, ſomething lighter in colour then crown gold.</p>
                        <p>For the colour of pure gold (as an angell Yellow. or royall) is a right yellow colour.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Light ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron.</note>A light ſaffron colour is, that colour that ſaffron doth make when it is ſteeped in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and laid light on any white.

                        <p>Crimſon is a dark bloody colour,<note place="margin">Crimſon.</note> well known by his own name, but is not in urine ſo light as it ſheweth in cloth.<note place="margin">Purple.</note> Purple, needeth not to be much deſcribed, being ſo commonly known, howbeit if you will ſee the making of it, mixe a dark crimſon, with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37337:60"/>an orient blew, and it will be purple. And becauſe that many men be deceived in the latin name of this colour, you ſhall obſerve that it is not that which in Latin is called <hi>Purpureus color,</hi> (as moſt men think) for that is rather a crimſon, but it is called, more peculiarly <hi>Purpura violacea,</hi> or <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus color.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Blew colour is the colour of the cleer Skie,<note place="margin">Blew.</note> or of Azure. Howbeit, in urine it is not ſo orient, but if you will mix pure white (as white lead, or pure lime) with due por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right black (as cole duſt, or other like) then there will of theſe àmount that blew, which is aſcribed to urine.</p>
                        <p>Green is a compound colour of blew and yellow duly tempred together.<note place="margin">Green.</note> And the right green have I in this Book called a ſtark green.<note place="margin">Stark green.</note> But if the yellow do exceed in it, then is it a light green; and contrariwiſe, if the blue do exceed,<note place="margin">Light green.</note> then is it a dark green: Of this green doth <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> mean, when hee doth ſay of divers herbs, that their leaves be black; and ſometime when he noteth white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines to be in herbs, he meaneth a light green, though he other times underſtandeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a certain horineſs; of which thing in mine Herball you ſhall read more exactly.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37337:60"/>their lightneſs of hue, and thinneſs of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the urine where they appear. The light oyly is ſomewhat lighter,<note place="margin">Light.</note> (or rather) brighter and more glittering then light green,<note place="margin">Stark.</note> So is the ſtark oylie brighter then the ſtark green, and the dark oylie then the dark green,<note place="margin">Dark.</note> which all cometh through the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſubſtance in the urine.</p>
                        <p>Aſh-colour is darker then blew, and is made of the ſame ſort that blew is,<note place="margin">Aſh-colour.</note> ſave that it requireth more of the black by twofold. This is the colour of lead, which is much darker then the inner part, though indeed both are one colour, and differ onely in brightneſs and darkneſs, which ought rather to be called the hue of colours, then colour.</p>
                        <p>Now as for black, I need not to ſpeak any whit, for as all men do know it,<note place="margin">Black.</note> ſo theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry letters do ſhew it, which though of all other it be moſt deadly, yet is it ſurely of all the moſt mightie, for it overcommeth all colours, and none can change it, ſo that well it may be called the colour of death. For as death overcometh all bodies, ſo black doth damp all colours; beſide, that it is the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger and token of death, which is the end of all things, and black the end of colours.</p>

                        <p>Ages.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe that in the judgement of urines, the differences of ages ought to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you ſhall underſtand that the chief dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of them are four, that is to ſay, <hi>Childhood, Youth, Manhood,</hi> and <hi>Old-age,</hi> for though there be commonly 7.<note place="margin">Childhood.</note> Ages rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, yet theſe be four principall, and the other three be comprehended under theſe four, childhood endureth from the hour of birth till the end of 14. yeers of age, and is of complexion hot and moiſt. At the end of 14. yeers beginneth youth,<note place="margin">Youth.</note> and laſteth till the 25 yeer, and this age of all other is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion the moſt temperate.

                        <p>Brightneſs in urine muſt be marked for a ſeveral thing from cleerneſs. For the bright-neſſe betokeneth the orientneſs and the beauty of the colour, with a certain gliſtring. And cleerneſs is referred to the ſubſtance of urine,<note place="margin">Clearneſs.</note> and is ever annexed with thinneſs of it. Yet is it a divers qualitie from thinneſs. So may an urine be cleer in ſubſtance, by the reaſon of his thinneſs, and yet not bright in colour, and not cleer in ſubſtance, but this would be well pondered, leſt this neceſſarie diſtinction, cauſe a negligent confuſion.</p>

                  <p>AN Ounce may weigh 600 grains. I got a glaſſe Veſſel with a narrow neck weighing 1354 graines, but filled with rain Water weighing over 4670 grains. The Urine of an old man is found to weigh in the ſame Veſſel 4720 grains, or to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the rain water 50. grains. But the Urine of a healthy woman, of the age of 55 yeers weighed 4745 grains. The Urine of an healthy yong man of 19 yeers of age weighed 4766 grains. But the Urine of another yong man of equall yeers, being abſtinent from drinking, weighed 4800 grains: And a yong man of 36 yeeres of Age, having a ſertian with a Cough, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 4763 grains. But the aforeſaid yong man of 19. yeers of Age, having a double Tertian, the night before drunk little; but his water weighed 4848 grains, which was 82 grains more then when he was in
<pb facs="tcp:37337:66"/>health. A Virgin troubled with a paſſion of the heart, made water like rain water, and which therefore equally weighed with the rain water. The Urine being warm, is alwayes found to bee a few grains lighter, then when it is cold, as alſo more large.</p>
                  <p>Lee therefore the veſſel be of a ſhort neck, and pointed ſo, that even in a point of time you may meaſure the Urine: To theſe other Obſervations may be added, by a curious Obſerver of theſe Directions ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: And it is a farre eaſier Method, then that which by another Author is reduced into Aphoriſms, by weighing out of the whole man; and ſo judging of his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar eſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turnheiſerus</hi> alſo, hath invented a new way of judging of Urines, in framing a Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorie Veſſel for urine, and diſtinguiſhing it into 24. parts, and marking it out, on the outſide with his lines, divideth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body into ſo many Sections, and then judgeth of them.</p>

And concerning their Doſes, how uncertainly they have delivered them, a ſearching man may eaſily diſcover; You had need collogue with the terme of worthy Countrymen, when you tell, the Colledge doth in effect ſay, they are great fools: but you would make them fit for the calling, if ſcurrility could faſten it on them.</p>
                     <p>The Apothecaries you ſay, would deſerve the name of a company of Dunces, if they ſhould complain againſt the Phyſitians, and not connive for their trade; but had my Gentleman gone out a Freeman in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the Doctors would have been ſo bold with him as to have, examined his ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, as they do others, before they paſſe their approbations for practiſe: You call Heaven to witneſſe, none of the Colledge have provoked you; Whence comes this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes then undeſervedly againſt them, but from (as you write) the <hi>Saturnine</hi> diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you were born under; you Aſtrologers, write, ſome Planets are evill in themſelves, yet joyned with ſome others, qualified with their conjunction are better affected, though Scripture teach you, when God had ſurveyed

I will not recite the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the chiefeſt part. <hi>Caeterum quod ad aegros attinet ſanandos, &amp;c.</hi> The Engliſh is this: And as concerning the curing of the ſick, I will ordain and deviſe for them as good a diet as ſhall lie in my power and judgement. And I will take heed that they fall in no damage nor hurt. Nor yet any mans prayers ſhall ſo much prevail with me, that I give poiſon to any man, neither will I counſell any man ſo to doe. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I will give no manner of medicine to any woman with child, to deſtroy her child. Moreover I will uſe my life and ſcience godly; I will not cut thoſe that have the ſtone, but I will commit that thing only to the Chirurgions. In what houſe ſoever I ſhall come in, my coming ſhall bee for the Patients commoditie and profit. And I wil refraine willingly from doing any hurt or wrong, and from falſhood, and chiefly from venereous acts, what kind of bodies ſoever I ſhal chance to have in cure, whether it be of men or women, of free or bond ſervants. And whatſoever I ſhall ſee or hear among my cures (yea although I be not ſought, nor called to any) whatſoever I ſhall know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people (if it be not lawfull to be uttered, I ſhall keep cloſe, and keep it as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37337:74"/>a Secret unto my ſelf. Again the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith in the Book or Chapter called <hi>Lex.</hi> (To eſchew tediouſneſs I will leave the Latine) Whoſoever ſaith he, will truly get him the knowledge of Phyſick, he muſt ſatisfie his mind, and as it were be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with theſe guides, with nature, ſcience, a place meet and convenient for ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and learning, an inſtitution from child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, a labour and painfull diligence with a long time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> In his Book <hi>De Medico,</hi> he ſaith, The Phyſitian muſt be of a good colour, and comely countenance, and of a good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the body, he muſt alſo be had in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation among the common people, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparrell, and by ſweet ſavours (ſo that he be not ſuſpected of too much exceſſe) for by ſuch means the Pacients are wont to be delighted.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, the Phyſitian muſt ſee and ſtudie, that he be of a modeſt and ſober mind, and not only concerning modeſt talk, but alſo in other things concerning his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, he muſt be well diſpoſed; for there is nothing that getteth a man better eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and authoritie then to be endued with an honeſt life and good manners. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance muſt be like one that is given to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37337:74"/>ſtudie, and ſad, and yet not overmuch, for ſo he ſhould be taken to be ſtubborn and ſcornfull, and like one that diſdaineth other mens company: but on the contrary, hee that hath alwaies a laughing countenance, and is given to too much geſture and mirth, is taken for a lend perſon; and therefore this muſt needs be eſchewed: Alſo he muſt be juſt and bear himſelf upright in all his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affaires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In his Book <hi>De decenti ornatu,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>A Phyſitian being a Philoſopher is equall in ſome reflects unto God. Item,</hi> it is decent that the Phyſitian be gentle and courteous, for rudeneſſe and churliſhneſs are greatly mifliked, as well of the whole as of the ſick. He muſt of ten viſit his Patient and be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. He may not declare all things to his Patient, but ſome things he muſt keep cloſe from him, and muſt comfort him with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and merry countenance. And ſometimes to withdraw him from his fond deſires, he muſt rebuke him, in reſiſting with ſharp words; and ſometimes again he muſt intreat and comfort him, with a dexteritie and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle perſwaſion. And yet notwithſtanding he may not alwaies tell him of his preſent ſtate, nor what ſhall become of him.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I have brought out of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:37337:75"/>to teſtifie and declare the office and condition of a Phyſitian. Now ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will I bring out of <hi>Galen,</hi> who in his Book intituled, <hi>quod optimus medicus idem eſt &amp; Philoſophus,</hi> declareth plainly by the very title of the Book it ſelf, what learning a Phyſitian ought to have. He ſaith alſo in his Book <hi>De Antidotis,</hi> That a Phyſitian if it be poſſible ought to have the knowledge of all herbs, if not, at the leaſt he ought to know thoſe which be commonly uſed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the Commentaries upon the firſt Book of <hi>Hippocrates, De morbis vulgari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus:</hi> The Phyſitian, ſaith he, ought in any wiſe to have a reſpect to profit and help his Pacients, and if he cannot, then at the leaſt wiſe that he hurt them not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item</hi> upon the 6. Book <hi>De morbis vulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> he ſaith, Albeit that the Phyſitian be gentle and courteous, ſober and alſo merry, yet nevertheleſſe he ought not to miniſh his gravitie, for unleſs the Patient have in reverence and eſtimation his Phyſitian as a god, he ſhal never follow and obey his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, it will be therefore very decent, that the Phyſitian do not ſo abaſe himſelf and flatter, that he bring himſelf in a contempt: Nor again, as it were another <hi>Callianactes,</hi> ſhew himſelf hoggiſh and rude. And that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:37337:75"/>ſhall he eaſily bring to paſſe, if in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and talke, and all his honeſt behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he retain the gravitie of a Phyſitian, and ſo do perſwade his Patient to follow and keep thoſe things that he appointeth and ordaineth for him.</p>
                     <p>But now leaſt I ſhould bee too tedious in alledging many Authors; I will come to thoſe of our time, and namely I wil bring that man of high learning and famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Maſter Doctor <hi>Silvius,</hi> who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was the publike Reader of Phyſick in the Univerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> having daily at his Lecture little leſſe then a thouſand Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors (or as they call them, Scholers) of the which I being one, may plainly teſtifie it to be true. The ſame <hi>Silvius</hi> ſaith in his Book, <hi>De ordine legendi libros. Galeni &amp; Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratis,</hi> That a good Phyſitian muſt have all theſe properties.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he muſt be naturally bent and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only to truth, all the dayes of his life, he muſt be circumſpect, diſcreet, and of a good pregnant wit and memorie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he muſt have a ſound and healthie bodie, and muſt be able to abide great pain in ſtudying.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he muſt be endued with great riches, or at leaſt he muſt have ſufficient to live by.</p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:37337:76"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, he muſt have and get his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the beſt learned men of his time, who diligently even from his childhood muſt inſtruct him with theſe ſciences: Grammer, Logick, Muſick, Aſtronomie, and chiefly (as <hi>Plato</hi> counſelleth) Arithmetick and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie, and alſo Philoſophie.</p>
                     <p>Now to come to my chief intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and (as they are wont to ſay) to the Principall: Theſe things above rehearſed, well weighed and conſidered, what hope may there be conceived? what foundation and ſtay may be had? yea what ſecurity and ſafeguard is there in theſe ſort of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, which now a dayes almoſt in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo raſhly, ſo fondly, and ſo wickedly do abuſe the noble Art and Science of Phyſick. Where is their great and manifold know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the tongues, of the liberall Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of Philoſophie, of Anatomie, of the Simples, of the compound Medicines, and of the Temperatures or Complexions? where have they ſtudied? of whom have they learned their Science? (if I may call it a Science) what Authors have they ſeen or read. Many of them will anſwer and ſay unto me thus: Sir, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have not this exquiſite knowledg that you require in us, yet we have had
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:37337:76"/>experience of many things, we have Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Books enough to teach us divers me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines for divers purpoſes, yea and ſome of us have a gift of nature to heal many diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that your reaſoning is fair, but it is grounded upon a very ſlender and feeble foundation. For firſt, as touching your experience, how can it be good unleſs it be joyned to knowledge and ſcience? What though you have given a Medicine: As for example, a purgation to purge fleam to any man in the Winter, ſuppoſing that man to be ſome what aged, of a flegmatick complexion, uſing much flegmatick meats, much ſleep and much reſt: and that the ſaid Purgation hath taken good effect and wrought well, all this ſuppoſed; Let the like medicine be given in the Summer to a man of another complexion, of another diet, and of another age yea ſuppoſing this, that it bee given to the ſelfe ſame man in the Summer; Shall the ſame Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation (thinke you) take ſuch effect and operation, as it did afore in the winter? no verily; or elſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Father and Founder of all Phyſick (whoſe ſayings and writings we follow and credit, <hi>tanquam Apollinis oracula</hi>) ſhould have
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:37337:77"/>fouly erred, and ſpecially in his Book <hi>De Natura Humana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> in his third Book, <hi>De methodo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi,</hi> ſaith, That there be two inſtruments of all manner of invention, that is to ſay, Reaſon and experience. He that knoweth a thing that is invented and found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and yet cannot tell the reaſon of it why it is ſo: plainly declareth to know it only by experience. But that hee may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how much he erreth, let him give ear unto me a while, for I mean to talk a few words with him, which follow only experience. Thus much <hi>Galen;</hi> what hee ſaith after, I leave it, leſt I bee too tedious.</p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Galen</hi> alſo upon the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſm</hi> of the firſt Book of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> The experience (ſaith he) of Phyſick is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, (which be alſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> words) for the materiall ſubject of Phyſick is no tile ſtones, or common ſtones, dirt, wood, or leather, as they are of other crafts and ſciences, in the which you may make or mar any thing without danger. For if you ſpill a peece of wood or leather in miſ-handling it, there is no danger, but onely a little loſſe or damage, which is ſoon recovered again by diligence. But to prove things in mans bodie which bee not afore approved by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:37337:77"/>learning and experience, is not without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death.</p>
                     <p>Now as concerning your ſecond reaſon, by the which you affirm to have many Engliſh Books that teach you Phyſick: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the Engliſh Books teach nothing of the true foundation of Phyſick. For if there be any that do it, how can it be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood without Logick and Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi deſinit Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, ibi incipit Medicus.</hi> A man muſt firſt peruſe Naturall Philoſophie, before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>I doe not deny but to have ſome Books of Phyſick in Engliſh, ſpecially of the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, well and cunningly ſet forth for Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions, Apothecaries, yea, and for ſober and wiſe men that delight to read in ſuch things, and know not the Latine tongue, is not unmeet nor hurtfull. Although I would not wiſh, nor it is not decent, that either Chirurgion or Apothecarie, or any other man, being no Phyſitian ſhould practiſe or uſe any inward Medicine without the learned and approved Phyſitians counſell. For as the two Proverbs ſay; <hi>Falcem ne mittas in meſſem alienam, Et ne ſutor ultra crepidam,</hi> let no man meddle with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans corn, but with his own. Let the Shoomaker meddle with his ſhooes.</p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:37337:78"/>
                     <p>But to the purpoſe, doe you think to have in your Engliſh Books, all the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is required in Phyſick? Yea, have you the tenth part onely? We could never have it yet in Greek and Latine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly (notwithſtanding we have it now better then ever we had before) how then ſhould you have it? If Engliſh Bookes could make men cunning Phyſitians, then Pouch-makers, Threſhers, Ploughmen, and Coblers might be Phyſitians as well as the beſt, if they can read.</p>
                     <p>Then were it a great folly for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſo much labour and ſtudy all our life time in the Schooles and Univerſities, to break our braines in reading ſo many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, to be at the Lectures of ſo many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, yea, and the greateſt folly of all were, to proceed in any degree in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities with our great coſt and charges, when a Sir <hi>John</hi> lacke Latine, a Pedler, a weaver, and oftentimes a preſumptuous woman, ſhall take upon them (yea, and are permitted) to miniſter Medicine to all men, in every place, and at all times. <hi>O tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora! O mores! O Deum immortalem!</hi> To what purpoſe have the Univerſities been erected and founded in times paſt? To what purpoſe have they ſo many goodly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37337:78"/>granted unto them of all Princes, ſucceſſively from all ages? what doth it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile for us that be learned to proceed (as I ſaid) in any degree of Maſter, of Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or Doctor, and ſo to be allowed and have authority to uſe our Science? when every man, woman, and child that liſt, may practiſe and uſe Phyſicke <hi>(idque impune)</hi> as well as we? and ſo, many times not onely hinder and defraud us of our lawfull ſtipend and gaines: but (which is worſt of all, and too much to be lamented) ſhall put many in hazard of their life, yea, and be the deſtruction of many. Is this tolerable? Will the Magiſtrates alwayes wink at this? Shall there never be no reformation for ſuch abuſes? God of his great mercy grant that once they mey be reformed. For if they be not, verily it will greatly diſcourage men of learning hereafter to apply themſelves to the ſtudy of Phyſicke, whereby the helpe, ſuccour and ſafeguard of many a ſick man, woman, and childe, ſhall be hindred and ſecluded: yea, and many ſhall fall in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and be ſick, which otherwiſe might be preſerved from all ſickneſſe by the right miniſtery of Phyſicke. For Phyſick is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed not onely to expell ſickneſs, but alſo to preſerve the body in health.</p>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:37337:79"/>
                     <p>But now to the third part I anſwer: You ſay, that you heale many times by the gift of Nature: I pray you tell me what you meane by Nature. Perhaps you underſtand by Nature, a naturall inclination or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, given by the influence of Starres and Planets, (as I doe not deny, but that we may be the better moved and inclined to any Art by their influence) yet is it not a meer gift, but onely a diſpoſition, and as it were a dexterity and naturall to wardneſſe to heale ſome kind of diſeaſe: which thing notwithſtanding is oftentimes done more by chance, then by any certaine Method, or Reaſon. For verily, have you never ſo good a wit, diſpoſition and inclination to any Art: yet if you apply not that Art, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe your ſelfe in it earneſtly, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and ſpecially in this Science of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick (which can neer be well uſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great ſtudy, and the knowledge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rs other Sciences, as I have ſaid before) your doings ſhall be but raſh, vaine, and of ſmall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ffect. For as the Philoſopher ſaith: <hi>Scientiae nobis, non innaſcuntur, ſea acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtur,</hi> The Sciences are not infuſed in us at our birth, but are gotten afterward: And Science is thus defined in Logick: Science is an habit, (that is) a ready, prompt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37337:79"/>and bent diſpoſition to doe any thing, confirmed and gotten by long ſtudy, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and uſe. Therefore the naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the influence of the Starres can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit but little, unleſſe you apply your ſelfe with great diligence and ſtudy to that kinde of Science or Art that you intend to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and follow.</p>
                     <p>But if you underſtand (by Nature) God: I ſay plainly, that God doth not give the gift of healing to any wicked people, but onely by aſpeciall priviledge to thoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that be of a moſt pure, ſober, and holy life, as we read of the Apoſtles, and ſome of the Prophets. And as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> the 12. <hi>chap. To ſome is given the gift of healing by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So that to heale by this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of means, is not commonly to uſe Herbs, Rootes, or any other drougs bought at the Apothecaries ſhop, or to take any money or other reward for the healing. For this kinde of healing is the meer gift of God, working in thoſe (to whom it pleaſeth God to give it) without any labour or ſtudy. We hear of none now a dayes, that hath this gift of nature (I mean of God) ſaving one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and the French Kings, which, as the excellent Doctor <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaultius</hi>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:37337:80"/>ſaith, in the firſt book of his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgiry, have a ſpeciall gift to heal the Kings Evil, called <hi>ſtruma</hi> in Latine.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I conclude, that howſoever you make your argument, your profeſſion and practiſe in Phyſick is hothing worth, but rather is falſe, deceitfull, unjuſt, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and not any longer to be ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>I could now, if I were not too tedious to the Readers, bring and alledge out of the Authors of Phyſick, certaine notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of many raſh and dangerous cures, that hath been done by many ignorant and lewd perſons in times paſt, if it were not that the dayly examples appeared (alas) too much before our eyes in theſe our dayes.</p>
                     <p>I will ſay nothing now of the City of <hi>Salisbury</hi> where I dwell, what abuſes hath been, or be there now, concerning the Art of Phyſick. A reformation hath been made there, not very long agone, as touching ſuch matters, but yet all things are not ſo well brought to paſſe as I would wiſh, and as I thinke good they were. I delivered once, certaine Articles concerning the honeſt and lawfull uſe of Phyſick, unto the right reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend father in God my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> which Articles being (at the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37337:80"/>leaſt in my judgement) good and lawfull, if it would pleaſe his Lordſhip, yea, and all other moſt honourable Biſhops, each of them in his Dioces, to admit and put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. I would ſuppoſe, <hi>imo,</hi> I would beleeve that Phyſick ſhould be better and more honeſtly, truly and juſtly uſed and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred then it is now in theſe dayes.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe that I would that every man ſhould ſee and know, what Articles they be that I delivered, I have thought it good to take a copy of them (which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I have ſomewhat altered) and rehearſe them here in order.</p>

                        <p>Theſe Articles above rehearſed, I thought good here to alledge, (although under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of my ſuperiors) becauſe that ſome occaſion may be given to reforme the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and abuſes in the Science of Phyſick. And here let no man thinke, that I meane
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37337:82"/>to ſpeake any thing in any point againſt the priviledges and liberties granted by an Act of Parliament to the Company or Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Phyſitions of <hi>London,</hi> for I mind not, nor may not meddle with their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
                        <p>Many there are, that beare themſelves very ſtout, upon an Act that was made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. in his daies, affirming that Act to make full and wholly in all points for their purpoſe, but they are fouly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and farre beyond the marke that they ſhoot at. For whereas the Act preſuppoſeth in them a knowledge of the ſimples, as of herbes, rootes, and waters, and of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and operation of them. Alas, they can ſcant tell what a ſimple meaneth: There be a great number of them that knoweth not theſe common Herbs, <hi>Bugloſſum, Apium &amp; agrimonia,</hi> for in ſtead of <hi>Bugloſſum,</hi> which is Bourage, they will take Bugloſe, being deceived by the ſound of the word: for <hi>agrimonia</hi> the true <hi>Eupatorium.</hi> They will take <hi>Eupatorium Meſue,</hi> which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed of <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> under the name of <hi>ageratum,</hi> for <hi>apium</hi> Parſly, they take commonly Smallage: for <hi>Scolopendria,</hi> called otherwiſe <hi>Ceterach,</hi> they abuſe Harts-tongue. And to be ſhort, I my ſelfe have
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:37337:82"/>ſeen ſome Apothecaries take for the root of <hi>Rubia,</hi> the leaves of <hi>Rubus:</hi> for the root of <hi>Mandragora,</hi> the root of <hi>Gentian:</hi> for <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matites; Amethyſtus:</hi> for <hi>Sempervivum minus,</hi> the Herb called <hi>Thrift,</hi> or great <hi>Stonecrope,</hi> they have taken little <hi>Stonecrope</hi> in making their <hi>Populeum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the purpoſe, whereas the Act preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a ſpeculation or practiſe, they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe at a venture a thing which they know not, whether it be cold, or hot, dry, or moiſt.</p>
                        <p>Item, whereas the Act giveth them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to miniſter Drinkes for the Stone, Strangury, and Agues: They know not the Stone in the back, from the Stone in the bladder; neither whether the ſtone may be waſted and broken by Drinkes and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or had out by inciſion. Moreover, they know no difference between a Colike and a Stone: for they name them both one, whereas they be two ſundry diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>They know not what <hi>Stranguria</hi> is, nor how many manner of wayes it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in the body.</p>
                        <p>They can ſcant diſcerne a Tertian Ague from a Quotidian. As for the mixt and complicate Agues, they know not what to make of them; They call them new
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:37337:83"/>diſeaſes, becauſe they can give them no
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name.</p>
                        <p>Now verily, if theſe jolly fellowes had but that knowledge onely, which the ſaid act preſuppoſeth them to have, it were not ſo great a danger, if they ſometimes were permitted to give ſome medicines for the foreſaid diſeaſes. But I pray you, how many of them have that little knowledge? which knowledge is but little indeed in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of many other ſciences, which be not only profitable, but alſo neceſſary to attain the noble Science of Phyſick. If the other Acts which have been made for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Phyſick, be well ſcanned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred together one with another, it ſhall plainly appear, that the aforenamed act, ſhall not make ſo greatly for their purpoſe, who by ignorance and raſhneſſe do uſe to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Phyſick at their pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>Verily I much marvell at one thing, that many which be of the higher ſort, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves to bee of no ſmall gravitie and wiſedome will ſometimes give credit to ſuch leud perſons, counterfeiting the Phyſitians. Indeed, I ſuppoſe that they be partly deceived by the vain perſwaſions and fair flattering ſpeech of ſuch fellowes. Their communication is ſo fair, ſweet, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37337:83"/>pleaſant and amiable; and their promiſe and warranting ſo earneſt and great, that they will go nigh to deceive the wiſeſt man that is, if he have not the more grace, and be very ware of them. And the better to allure the ſimple people unto them: They will ſay to him whom they do take in hand; Sir, I will none of your money now untill you be whole, I will have money of you only for the medicines which I muſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie for your diſeaſe. They will lightly warrant every man to heal him, of what diſeaſe ſoever he hath; and for all diſeaſes they have commonly but two or three ſorts of medicines, and yet moſt commonly they be Purgations or Vomits.</p>
                        <p>They purge ſo much and ſo often, that they purge many times, as well the ſoul out of the body, as the money out of the purſe.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, theſe fellowes will alſo (to have the more credit given unto them) name them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after ſome great learned mans name. Sometimes they fain themſelves to be of ſome ſtrange countrie, and will counterfeit their language (as I know one in <hi>Salisburie</hi>) and look to be called by ſome name of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or worſhip; as Maſter, Gentleman, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Doctor, and all to deceive the people.</p>
                        <p>O, I would wiſh that every man would
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37337:84"/>take heed, and I beſeech God that every man may beware or ſuch falſe Phyſitians, which may be likened to Wolves or Foxes, clothed outwardly with lambs skins, but inwardly are full of ſubtilty and deceit. Many periſh through the yeer at their hands, whereby the good ſcience of Phyſick is brought into an obloquie and reproach.</p>
                        <p>Many learned Doctors of our time have in their works envied greatly againſt theſe abuſes, and have wiſhed ſome puniſhment to be eſtabliſhed by the Magiſtrates, unto ſuch as wickedly and without all reaſon miſuſe and practice this Science.</p>
                        <p>Here I could alſo ſomewhat touch ſome of the learned ſort, which although they bear themſelves never ſo ſtout, and appear to men to do all things well, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they halt ſometimes on both ſides: They ſee and know many abuſes in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries ſhops, and yet they winke at the matter, and are loath to diſpleaſe the Apothecary, who perchance is their friend. But the Proverb ſaith; <hi>Amicus Socrates, Amicus Plato, Amica tamen magis verita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           </hi> The truth ought to take place in all things, and above all things.</p>
                        <p>There be alſo many Phyſitians that think themſelves ſo profoundly learned, that they
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37337:84"/>beleeve that no man is able to match with them in learning, they be ſo arrogant and ſcornfull, that although the Patient be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have the counſell of two or three other Phyſitians to conſult and confer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of his diſeaſe, yet they will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant to it, but rather diſdain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with any other, the which perchance are ſometimes a great deale better learned then they are. They remember not what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> their Maſter ſaith, in his Book <hi>De preceptionibus,</hi> who being in Latine tranſlated ſaith thus, <hi>Nec vero indecore ſe illegeret medicus, &amp;c.</hi> The Engliſh is thus, That Phyſitian ſhall not do amiſſe, nor behave himſelf uncomely, which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed in the buſineſs about his Patient, and doubtful for want of perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, doe cauſe other Phyſitians to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that by common deliberation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring one with another, the Pacients af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs may be duly examined and known, ſo that they may be as co-adjutors (that is to ſay, helpers one to another) to provide for ſome remedy. Some there be alſo (leſt that other men ſhould learn their cunning) that will rather ſcrible them a Receit, and will make ſuch daſhes and ſtrange abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations in their Bills, that their writing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37337:85"/>ſeemeth rather to be Arabick, or like the the writings of the <hi>Cabaliſts,</hi> then Latine. I fear me that they that write ſo, are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their own occupation, and fear leſt that if they ſhould write plain, their errors and faults ſhould be eſpied. He that is a plain man will deal plainly, will ſpeak plainly, and write plainly.</p>
                        <p>Some there be alſo that be ſo ſtiffe neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and heady in their opinions, that they will be or no man gainſaid in any wiſe, no, and if you bring them never ſo good a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, although you alledge them never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny authorities.</p>
                        <p>But I ſay, <hi>Plus vident duo oculi<expan>

                        <p>Alſo ſome Phyſitians there bee, that bee ſo greedie, and of ſuch an unſatiable deſire, that they care not in what danger they caſt themſelves, what ſhame and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage they ſuſtain, ſo that they may have many cure, where ſometimes one would ſuffice them well enough, and be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance then they can well bring to paſſe.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37337:85"/>They be ſo covetous that they would have all, and do all themſelves, and they envie many times at other honeſt men having cures, when they have none. Thus doing, verily, they bring themſelves in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and doth as it were abate and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh the honourable Science of Phyſick, which requireth rather to be ſought earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with great ſure, with humilitie, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and praying, then to be offered, and as it were objected undiſcreetly to every man, and in every place, like a blind Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſong, or a Pedlers pack. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proverb ſaith, <hi>That offered ſervice ſtinks.</hi> And I have heard oftentimes ſay, That Phyſick unleſs it be earneſtly ſought and well paid for, it will never proſper nor work well with the Patients: I mean not by this that the Phyſitian muſt be alwayes liberall and mercifull to the poor, on whom his living dependeth not, but on the rich.</p>
                        <p>Now to conclude and finiſh this firſt part, I will leave to intreat any more of Phyſitians, (except as occaſion ſhall ſerve) and now in the next Part following, I will ſpeake of Apothecaries, and touch ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what their abuſe and negligence.</p>

                     <p>And I beleeve verely, that if every Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarie would endeavour himſelf to buy no ſtuffe, but that ſhould be pure and good: there would be a great many, that would give better credit to Phyſitians and Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, and have a better hope in them, then they have now a dayes, and all becauſe they miſtruſt and ſuſpect ſo much the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries ſtuffe and confections. Indeed, as covetouſneſſe is the root of all evill, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Apothecaries there be, that more for lucre ſake and greedineſſe of worldly goods, doe prepare their Medicines, then for any care that they have, to deale truly with the poore Pacients and ſillie ſoules that be in paine, The Phyſitian many times ſhall ordaine his counſell, and appoint certaine Medicines for his Pacient; which Medicines he knoweth certainly ſhall doe him good, being taken and uſed according to his counſell, yet the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:37337:87"/>ſame Medicines being taken and bought at the Apothecaries, and made many times of naughty ſtuffe, or not well prepared, ſhall not only doe little or no good at all; but ſhall alſo ſometimes put the ſicke body in hazard of his life, whereby ſhall no ſmall trouble and ſhame redound unto the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and yet was he not the occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, nor in any fault at all. Some perchance will alledge againſt the Phyſitian, that he may be in the fault, foraſmuch as he ought to have ſeen the ſtuffe firſt, whereof the compoſitions are made, and ought alſo to have been at the making and preparing of the Medicines which he ordaineth.</p>
                     <p>Indeed it ought to be ſo, if all things went well, and ſpecially if the Apothecarie be ſuſpected to have ſomewhat a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or that he be of a ſlender learning and negligent, and paſſeth not what he doth ſo that he may receive money. But you muſt underſtand that the Phyſitian cannot alwaies be preſent at the making or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of ſuch Medicines as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. For ſometimes he hath mo Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to look to then one, and perchance he may be twenty or forty miles from the Apothecarie, when he ſendeth his Bill to him, and therefore cannot be preſent.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37337:88"/>Many other occaſions there be, that letteth the preſence of the Phyſitian at the making and delivering of medicines.</p>
                     <p>We had a ſad paſſage of an Apothecary of late yeers, who being preſcribed by a Doctor to make up ſome Trochiſes for his Patient of <hi>Gordonius,</hi> not having them ready, uſed in their room Trochiſes of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hohengi in opio,</hi> which the Patient took, and dyed within few houres after; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Widdow of the deceaſed Patient, inſtigated by ſome of her friends, proſcuted the ſaid Apothecary; firſt for life, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to prohibite him for further uſing his trade, with two ſeverall Bills and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditements at the Kings Bench Bar, before that Learned and Reverend Judge, the then Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Brampſton,</hi> where with much charge he was acquitted, in both the ſeverall Trials.</p>
                     <p>But if the Apothecarie be an honeſt man, of a good conſcience and learned; or that he hath ſuch a one under him to ſerve the ſhop, that is of like qualities, It is not then ſo greatly neceſſary for the Phyſitian to be preſent, ſo often as he ordaineth his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell for any Patient. For even as a good tree will alwaies bring forth good fruit: So will a good Apothecary make and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:37337:88"/>nothing at any time, but that that is lawfull and good. But this Queſtion (if a man might be ſo bold) I would fain ask how many good Apothecaries be there in <hi>England?</hi> how many do their duties as they ought to do? how many are learned? how many are faithfull? and how many are willing and deſirous that the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould ſee their Drugs, and ſee the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their compoſitions? Many there be that diſdain that the Phyſitians ſhould bee preſent at the making of their Medicines, and who more then the ignorant, covetous, and contentious ſort of Apothecaries. The ignorant thinks (following their barbarous <hi>Nicolans</hi>) that their knowledge (which is meer ignorance far excelleth and ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the knowledge of all Phyſitians. The covetous are afraid, leſt if the Phyſitians ſhould be preſent that they ſhould find a great deal of their ſtuffe to be ſophiſticate, corrupt and naught.</p>
                     <p>There be alſo another ſort of Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which be ſo arrogant and ſcornfull (by reaſon that they be grown very rich, God knows how) that they diſdain the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, and have him in no eſtimation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the ancient time, the Apothecaries (as <hi>Galen</hi> and others witneſſe) were but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:37337:89"/>as ſervants and miniſters unto the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Commentaries upon the ſixt Book of <hi>Hippocrates, De morbis vulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> ſaith thus, The Miniſters of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, are gatherers of herbs, ointment ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, cooks, plaiſter-makers, cliſter-givers, ſcarifiers, letters out of bloud, but if wee (meaning of Phyſitians) after that wee have learned theſe things do alſo ſometimes the like, we do no otherwiſe then even as a maſter or governour of a Ship, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge in rowing, do row when he liſt, and get up to the top of the maſt, and doth all other things belonging to the Marriners art and office. Thus much <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I need not to alledge here the 38. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> where every man is exhorted to honour the Phyſitian, how much more then ſhould the Apothecarie honour and reverence him, which hath chiefly his living by means of the Phyſitian. I ſpeak not this becauſe I, or any Phyſitian ſhould ſeek worldly honour, or vainglory. For above all things, <hi>Soli Deo ſit honor &amp; gloria,</hi> yet notwithſtanding, according to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, we ought to <hi>give honour to whom honour belongeth.</hi> I remember that when I was yet in a manner but a boy,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:37337:89"/>in age, ſtudying beyond the ſea, after a year or two that I had ſtudied in Phyſick; I would ſometimes (for to have the better knowledge in ſimples) reſort to ſome Apothecaries ſhop or other. But I ſhould no ſooner come into the ſhop (ſpecially of learned and honeſt men) but that immediatly the Apothecarie would welcome and receive me with all courteſie and humanitie, and riſe from his ſeat to give me room, and ſo would enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me with all gentleneſs that he might. This did they to me being then but a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, what would they doe think you to the Maſters and Doctors of Phyſick? What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many Apothecaries now a dayes to ſet ſo little by the Phyſitians? This is one chief cauſe, they play the Phyſitians themſelves, they give and Miniſter Medicines of their own deviſe (God wot a mad device) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently unto all men, yea, and the more ignorant they are, the more bolder they be; for who is ſo bold as blind Bayard? Many of them will not ſtick to looke in waters, and not be aſhamed even in the Phyſitians preſence, to ordain this or that Medicine for any kind of diſeaſe; If any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian do gently admoniſh them of their fault, and ſpecially of giving of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines after their own brain: They will
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37337:90"/>ſay, that they may as well preſcribe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, as Phyſitians ſometimes do uſe to make them. They may play (ſay they) as well the Phyſitians, as the Phyſitians play the Apothecaries, as though a Phyſitian and an Apothecarie were all one. Indeed a Phyſitian maybe an Apothecarie, and have an Apothecaries, ſhop within himſelf in his own houſe, or may be a Chirurgion, and heal wounds or ſores, or let blond himſelf: <hi>Sed non è diverſo.</hi> An Apothecary or Chirurgion being onely of that Art may not be a Phyſitian, unleſſe hee abuſe and falſely exerciſe againſt all reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, (as many do now a daies) the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>To prove that a Phyſitian may make, or cauſe to be made, in his own houſe any kind of Medicines: it may partly appear by the authoritie of <hi>Galen</hi> before alledged, and alſo by divers other famous Authors of our time, and ſpecially by <hi>Manardus</hi> and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius. Manardus</hi> in the Prologue prefixed to the Annotations upon <hi>Meſue,</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>In times paſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans themſelves prepared the Medicines at their own houſes, and ſo kept them ready made, the which as often as need required, according to their diſcretion, and the neceſſity
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:37337:90"/>of the ſick, they uſed. But ſince theſe five hundred yeers or thereabout, this kind of buſineſs hath been committed or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Phyſitians, (not without, as I beleeve, the danger of the Patients) unto certain which are called Spicers, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jacobus Silvius</hi> in his Book <hi>De Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentorum ſimplicium delectu,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, whereas he ſpeaketh of the duty of an Apothecarie, declareth, that as well <hi>Galen,</hi> as other Phyſitians, did oftentimes prepare the Medicines themſelves. It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then for the Phyſitian (if he liſt) to prepare the Medicines for his Pacient him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but not lawfull for the Apothecarie to uſe or practiſe phyſick for any man of his own head.</p>
                     <p>I would wiſh that the Apothecary, as he is deſirous of gain, ſo he would provide all things neceſſary for his ſhop; and chiefly, and firſt of all, for the chief guide and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, that ſhould rule all the roſt, I mean the Book of <hi>Bernardus, Deſſennius, Cronemburgius, De compoſitione medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum:</hi> The perfecteſt in my opinion, and moſt excellent Book, I beleeve, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was made for Apothecaries. Howbeit, becauſe that ſome Phyſitians uſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37337:91"/>of other Authors; I would wiſh alſo that the Apothecatie might not bee without the Diſpenſatories of <hi>Valerius Cordus,</hi> of <hi>Fuchſius,</hi> or <hi>Nicolaus Mirep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> or the two Books of <hi>Silvius,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chooſing, keeping, and making of Medicines commonly uſed: Or, <hi>Examen tam ſimplicium quae compoſitorum, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii Muſae,</hi> and not to follow ſtill their blind <hi>Nicolaus Praepoſitus,</hi> which is full of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. It were meet and convenient alſo, that the Apothecaries had divers ſearces to ſearce their Powders in, for ſome Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders would be ſearced very finely, as they that be Dieuretick powders, and moſt part of Electuaries: ſome more groſſie, as the moſt part of Laxatives, except <hi>Agarick</hi> and <hi>Colocinthis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apothecaries have many excellent Diſpenſatories to direct them, in making up their Compoſitions, as the new <hi>Phama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copaea Londinenſis,</hi> that of <hi>Renodeus,</hi> of <hi>Bauderon, Bertaldus,</hi> the <hi>Pharmacopaea Auguſtava</hi> and others: As alſo in Chymick preparations, <hi>Grulingius,</hi> and thoſe two excellent Peeces ſet forth by <hi>Schraderus,</hi> his <hi>Pharmacopaea</hi> and <hi>Quercitanus Rodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivus,</hi> and I preſume there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of worth, in the Manuſcript I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37337:91"/>at the end of this Work, though hee have failed in his judgement; in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is ho Salt in Vegetables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Guinther Bilich</hi> hath given a ſufficient refutation to that folly, nor can he blemiſh well deſerving <hi>Quercetan</hi> with the Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>Of Morters likewiſe they ought to have divers ſorts for all precious Stones, (that enter into Electuaries) and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ought not to be beaten in a braſen mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but Pearls and Corall ought to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a morter of white marble; precious ſtones muſt be made or grinded into pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon a ſtone called in Latine, <hi>Lapis Porphirius,</hi> which is a kind of red marble. Alſo Purgations, or Electuaries, Pills or powders mingled with any Syrrups ought not to be diſſolved in brazen morters, but in morters of glaſſe, of ſtone, or of ſome fine wood; yea, and if they were of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for great men of high degree, it were beſt. Alſo ſome Ointments ought to be made in morters of lead.</p>
                     <p>It were good alſo that no kind of poiſon ſhould be pounded or diſſolved, in any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters occupied daily for the ſhop, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath chanced much evill.</p>
                     <p>I had almoſt forgotten one great abuſe,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37337:92"/>that a great many Apothecaries commonly do uſe, that is, when the Phyſitian preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth any <hi>Loſengis</hi> to be made. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary will put to the powder as much ſugar as pleaſeth him, inſomuch that many times the <hi>Loſengis</hi> ſhall have little other taſte, then of the ſugar only, <hi>Fuchſius</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that there ſhould be but thrice as much ſugar as is of the powder, ſo that to three drams or powder, there ſhould be put but an ounce und a little more of ſugar, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that ſome other (as he ſaith) do uſe to put four times as much ſugar as of the pouder. But <hi>Deſſennius Cronemburgius</hi> ſaith, that the Phyſitians put commonly a pound of ſugar, to an ounce of powder. And to ſay my fancie and opinion, it were good that the Phyſitian ſhould determine and appoint in his Bill, how much ſugar hee would have to be put with the powder. For ſometimes it happeneth that he ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Purgation in <hi>Loſengis,</hi> ſometimes he uſeth ſome bitter pouder, or very hot pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that requireth of ſugar more or leſſe, but commonly bitter or very hot pouders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more ſugar; and pleaſant and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ponders require leſſe: but many Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries are very liberall, which ſpare for no ſugar when they make <hi>Loſengis,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37337:92"/>they have more reſpect to their profit, then to the Patients health. Again, they love to make all things pleaſant and ſweet, ſo that ſweet money may come in. And it is moſt commonly ſeen, that the moſt part of ſick folk abhorre ſweet things. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould know of the Phyſitian (unleſs he determine it himſelfe in his Bill) how much ſugar he will have to the making of the Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Now at the laſt to conclude, becauſe that Apothecaries ſhall know partly what their dutie is, I will here recite what <hi>Silvius</hi> ſaith in the place before alledged, of the Apothecaries duty. And thus I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated his preface into Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>Although that the Apothecarie be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with many things, commonly a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Phyſitian: as with naturall diſcretion, a perfect knowledge of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, a great diligence in all ſuch things as belong to his office, and an honeſt beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; yet nevertheleſſe many things are in a manner peculiarly appropriated unto him, the which ſometimes were alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and belonging unto the Phyſitians, at what time they themſelves prepared the medicines, as it appeareth that <hi>Galen</hi> ſhould have done it, in many places by his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37337:93"/>writings. Now ſuch things as be proper to the Apothecaries are theſe: The chuſing Medicines gotten by diſcretion and long experience, afterward the manner to keep them, and to know the time when they are in their power and force, or when they are deſtiute from all vertue and corrupt. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, how and in what manner each of them ought to be uſed, either by it ſelfe alone, or elſe to ſeeth it, or to bruiſe or breake it with other, or to prepared after another ſort and manner. It is alſo convenient and neceſſary for an Apothecarie to know his Grammer, becauſe he may the better underſtand the compoſitions of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers, and alſo the daily writings (which commonly they call Receipts or Bills) of the Phyſitians. In the which writings, if perhaps they have written any thing more or leſſe then need is, or more unpleaſant then the Apothecarie conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in himſelf, to be meet and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the pacient, he then may gently tell and warn the Phyſitian of it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, we would that the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knew perfectly the Art and Science to chooſe the Medicines, to prepare them, and to compound their together. We would alſo have him to be contented with a meane
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37337:93"/>apparrell, to be merry and pleaſant in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication after an honeſt ſort, diligent in the Patients buſineſſe, to be no covetous, no laſcivious, no drunkard, nor contentious perſon: all which things are even in like manner to be obſerved of the Phyſitian as of the Apothecary, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his book, called, <hi>The Office or Duty of a Phyſitian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if the Apothecary be indewed with ſuch perfections of ſpirit, of the body and alſo of fortune: he will never give any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine (ſpecially being of any great opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to any man, unleſſe he be of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of ſome cunning Phyſitian; nay, neither will he give any thing, be it of never ſo little effect, knowing not the vertue of it. For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes certain remedies, although they ſeem but weak, yet nevertheleſs through quantity, qualitie, and ſpace of time being unwholſome, or the occaſion many times of great diſeaſes, and taketh away the right and true way of curation: Inſomuch that under ſuch remedies, the body being in cure, will ſoon afterward bear greater and ſtronger remedies, but not convenient to the purpoſe. Moreover he ſhall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any crime or fault, either for love or favour, or hatred, or fear; nor he may not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37337:94"/>bee ſeduced by monie or led by ignorance. Neither ſhall he give at any time any poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or things procuring abortion, any thing that is too old or out of uſe, things alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſophiſticate, or any <hi>Quid pro quo?</hi> But he ſhall ask counſell, (as often as need ſhall require) of a well learned Phyſitian, what ſimple or compound medicine is to be ſubſtituted and taken, for lack of one or the other. He ſhall not augment nor fortifie the quantity of any ſtrong medicine to the intent that by a greater evacuation inſuing, men ſhould ſuppoſe him to have better A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries ſtuffe then any other.</p>
                     <p>O! I Would the Apothecaries of theſe daies would frame themſelves to this rule, and the Phyſitians likewiſe on their ſide, Phyſick ſhould not then be ſo little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſet by, as it is now a dayes, yea by opprobrious words and taunts deſpiſed of a great many. Now I beſeech the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie and living God, that once he would make the Phyſitians and Apothecaries to be of that deſire and minde, that each of them would rather wiſh to be indeed, then to ſeem or to be called a right, good, and honeſt Phyſitian, a right, good, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Apothecarie.</p>
                     <p>And if they do neglect that godly gift
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37337:94"/>and grace, I pray God that once ſome puniſhment may bee appointed by the Laws and Statutes for them which will enterpriſe to practiſe a Science (ſo heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to mans bodie, when it is well mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and again ſo hurtfull and dangerous, when it is ignorantly and raſhly handled) before they know it. Thus much <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi> And here I will make an end of Apothecaries, now to the Chirurgions.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be many Chirurgians in this our time, that practiſe Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, more by blind experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then by any Science, who in uſing many things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to their Art, know almoſt the vertue and opperation of nothing that they doe uſe. For how ſhould they know it, when they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:37337:96"/>are altogether unlearned? yea, and many of them there are that know never a letter in the book. Whereas Chirurgery being coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as one or the chiefeſt parts of Phyſick, (having his practiſe chiefly in the time of warre) it were neceſſary that the Chirurgian were not onely prompt, feat, and diligent in his doings, but alſo that he were well learned in Philoſophy and Phyſick, and alſo ſome what in Aſtronomy.</p>
                     <p>But how many ſhall a man finde in a country that have learning? how many are there that proceed in their cures truly and uprightly as they ought? not very many I beleeve. For the moſt part being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and void of all good learning, yea, and know almoſt no part of anatomy (which is moſt neceſſary for a Chirurgian) cannot ſcarce heale a green wound, and ſome there be that can ſcant let a man blood (which is a handſome and pretty feat, and yet not ſo hard a thing to be done) not well apply a Ventoſe called otherwiſe a cupping Glaſſe, unleſſe they put the man to pain and trouble. There be ſome that eſteem themſelves ſo well exerciſed and perfect in the Art, that they thinke that no cure can come amiſſe to them. They will enterpriſe and take in hand all manner oft cures, be they never ſo
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:37337:96"/>hard or incurable: for they have fear of nothing, but raſhly goe to work in all things. They will cut, they will launce, they will cauteriſe (which they call ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with a hot burning iron) they will ſaw off a leg or an arme of the body, they will uſe corroſives that ſhall peirce even unto the hard bones, and they will make an iſſue almoſt for every trifle, and for every diſeaſe, without conſidering the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the whole matter, not weighing the ſtrength, the age, and the complexion of the body, beſides many other things that are greatly to be conſidered in ſuch caſes. And poſſible it is many times that the Patient hath need of ſome inward Medicine, which the Chirurgian can, nor may well give with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Phyſitians counſell.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it were very meet and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the Chirurgian ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take no hard or dangerous cure, without the Phyſitians advice. Howbeit, as I ſee now a dayes, the moſt part of them doe all things, following onely their own fantaſies.</p>
                     <p>They ſtick not to give Electuaries, Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups, and other Medicines themſelves, yea, and Purgations alſo: which thing me thinks is very uncomely. It is not reaſon that he that ſhould be but as a Miniſter unto the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:37337:97"/>Phyſitian (as I alledged before out of <hi>Galen,</hi> when I treated of Apothecaries) ſhould uſe the part of a Maſter and Phyloſopher, and ordaine ſuch things as he knoweth not the nature of. It is not unknown, that many poor Patients periſheth under ſuch raſh and lewd Chirurgians.</p>
                     <p>But to ſay the truth, the fault is not ſo much in them, as in thoſe that gird credit unto them. For as the world goeth now a dayes, if a Phyſitian, or Chirurgian hath a fair tongue, and hath alſo ſomewhat a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body, and can ſpeak (I will not ſay flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) indifferently on every mans ſide, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying each man according to his quality, deſire and mind: every man unleſſe he be very wiſe and circumſpect, will lightly give eare and credit unto him, and account him for a diſcreet and cunning man. Such a one ſhall lack nothing, he ſhall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, he ſhall have much curteſie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhewed him, finally, he ſhall have his whole hearts deſire, (that is money enough) For ſuch Fellowes by their ſubtilty and faire tongue, will allure more people unto them, and get themſelves more treaſure in one quarter of a yeare, then ſhall an honeſt and good Phyſitian in the ſpace of three yeares, and all by their fleering face and flattering words.</p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:37337:97"/>
                     <p>I would to God that all men would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of ſuch fellows, and remember the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb that ſaith: <hi>Dulci ſub melle ſaepe venena latent.</hi> Under ſweet meats is many times a poiſon hid. And as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hinc pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul O pueri fugite, latet anguis in herba,</hi> Take heed, and flee far hence O children, for the ſnake lieth privily hid under the graſſe.</p>
                     <p>It is written in the ancient Authors of Phyſick, that in the old time, the Phyſitians were wont to exerciſe Chirurgerie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Howbeit it hath been now of a long time, that the Chirurgions do onely exerciſe this part of Phyſick for many conſiderations, and chiefly for this occaſion, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vita brevis, ars vero longa,</hi> The life of man is ſhort in compariſon of the Science of Phyſick which is long. Therefore becauſe the Phyſitians cannot well give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſtudy divers other Sciences, which be neceſſary to Phyſick, and make Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and uſe alſo Chirurgerie, and go and viſit their Patients: It hath been thought good that other men called Chirurgions, (and yet having ſufficient knowledge) ſhould have the office and miniſterie to uſe and apply outward Medicines, and not to enterpriſe and uſe all Medicines for all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes both outward and inward, as ſome
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:37337:98"/>doe, for in ſo doing they go beyond their bounds.</p>
                     <p>There are excellent peeces of late put forth of Chirurgerie, as <hi>Glaudorfius, Hilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Paracelſus</hi> and others in Latine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Foelix Wartius</hi> in the German tongue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reads</hi> Works, <hi>Baniſters, Wood-hall, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi> by <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and others in Engliſh, <hi>Cooke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chirurgetie although it be a manuall Art, yet it hath his ſpeculation, which cannot be had without reading of divers Authors, and eſpecially <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Aetius, Paulus Aegineta,</hi> and of the latter Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Tagaultius, Hollerius, Bologuinus</hi> and others. As for <hi>Joannes de Vigo,</hi> whom the Chirurgions of our daies do now moſt follow; I would not that they ſhould ſo greatly truſt him, becauſe that he is not to be followed and read without great diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judgement, for the obſcuritie and doubts, yea and errors that be in him. He bringeth in many things in his Book, which belongeth rather to the Phyſitian to know and practiſe, then to the Chirurgion: as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuaries, Potions, Purgations, and many other inward medicines. If the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion have knowledge in Phyſick, I mean that he know the complexions, the nature
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37337:98"/>of Simples, and the effect and operation of Compoſitions, hee may uſe them, elſe not. For if he do, he ſhall do as a blind man that ſhooteth at a hare, he ſhall work at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and many times with the danger of his Patient.</p>
                     <p>I much marvell, why the Chirurgion ſhould diſdain to come ask counſell of the Phyſitian, when he hath any hard or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cure, it can be no hinderance to him, and to ſay the truth, it is no great profit to the Phyſitian, unleſſe it bee for ſome rich man. The good Phyſitian will uſe the poor as the poor, and the rich partly for his money, as well as for his love and friendſhip. For the Phyſitian muſt have his living by ſome kinde of perſons. And not only the Phyſitian, but alſo the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Chirurgion ſhould deal charitably with the poor, and uſe every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his capacity. But this I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Velut obiter,</hi> as by the way: Now to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Many perchance will ſay unto me, what needeth the Chirurgion come to aske any counſell of the Phyſitian for any cure that he taketh in hand, whereas it is well known that the Phyſitians (except one among an hundred) doe not uſe to practiſe Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:37337:99"/>themſelves, and by this means can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inſtruct the Chirurgion in that thing, that they know not.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that the moſt part of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Phyſick, do treat of Chirurgerie in their Works, and although we meddle little, or nothing, with outward diſeaſes, yet doe we know what belongeth to them, and how they ought to be cured. And I ſay alſo that Chirurgerie can never be well practiſed without learning, or a reaſonable way of proceeding which is called in Latine <hi>Rationalis methodus,</hi> the which the moſt part of Chirurgions have not. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; A man hath an hot inflammation, or (as commonly they call it) a ſwelling or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume in ſome outward part of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and feeleth great pain. What remedie ſhall the Chirurgion uſe for the expelling of it? he muſt firſt conſider what is the nature and qualitie of an Inflammation, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Greek <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> whether it bee ingendred of pure blood only, or elſe mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any other humour, what is the cauſe of it, and what be the ſignes?</p>
                     <p>Now let us ſuppoſe that the ſaid <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> be ingendred only of a ſuperfluous blood, and the cauſe Antecedent be <hi>Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora,</hi> that is, abundance of good blood in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37337:99"/>all the body. Now what ſhall the Chirurgion do in ſuch a caſe? ſhall he apply any thing to the ſwelling, without conſidering whether the body muſt be let blood or not? Whether the ſwelling or <hi>Phlegmon</hi> be yet <hi>in fluxu,</hi> that is a breeding; or <hi>in ſtatu,</hi> that is, in the worſt caſe that it can be; or in the declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether or when, he ought to uſe reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſives, reſolutions, or both together? The generall rule of Phyſick ſaith, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all inflammations, we ſhould uſe repercuſſives, that is, Medicines to repel, and drive back the fluxion of humors: But I put the caſe that the ſwelling be in the Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, or that one hath the Peſtilence. The Chirurgion perhaps following the generall rule, wil lay a Plaiſter to repel the ſaid inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or ſwelling. Doth he wel think you? he doth ſo well that either he putteth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in great jeopardy or elſe he killeth him.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the Chirurgion muſt thinke that a great many things muſt be conſidered more then one, as often as he undertaketh any cure of weight; and muſt thinke it no ſhame nor reproach to counſell with a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian in ſuch matters. For verily I ſay, (to conclude in few words) That no man be he Chirurgion or Apothecary, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver work well without a true method and learning. For look what thing ſoever hee
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:37337:100"/>taketh in hand, what cure ſoever he hath, he being deſtitute of learning, ſhall never bring it well to paſſe, without the aid, help, and counſell of the Learned Phyſitian; for if he chance to doe any notable cure, it ſhall be peradventure more by hap hazard, then by procurement and diligence. Here I could bring in many other abuſes of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie; as now ſome pretend and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Phyſick (to their ſhame, deceiving the people) under the cloak of Chirurgery; ſome drive off, and linger out the time, to have the more money. Some be ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, that they will warrant every Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, when oftentimes many by their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence (and for lack of a good diet, or ſome other good Medicines which ſhould be appointed by the Phyſitian) dye upon their hands. Some when they have done all that they can, and ſee that their Patient begin to go to wrack, then immediatly with all ſpeed, they will run to the Phyſitian with their Patients water, and then to ask coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell when it is too late: and all becauſe they will ſhake off the burthen from their own ſhoulders, to caſt it upon the Phyſitians neck, and to put all the fault in him, if any thing chance otherwiſe then well, that ſo they may be clean diſcharged and unbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37337:100"/>from all manner of blame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Some go from town to town, from market to market to utter their trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie (their ware I would have ſaid) and to ſhew their cunning among the homely and ſimple people of the country.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe wily and deceitfull faſhions are not yet throughly known, nor can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well be, untill ſuch time as a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be made by ſome Law or Statute, which I pray God to grant ſhortly, to his glory, the profit of the people, and for the good of the Common-wealth. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

                  <p>For the ſame faculty is not in a native Medicine, prepared by the ſaid wayes, or manner, for preparation changeth the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, ſome more, ſome leſſe. Seeing that eſpecially, on which fire worketh more ſtrongly, doth either leſſen, or conſume the moiſture, and conveyeth in an <hi>Eupyreuma,</hi> and ſomewhat changeth the faculty or the fiery heat, ſavour, and taſte, mingling the ſubtiler earthy parts with watry, when with his accidentary heat, it induceth ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Nor is any Medicine made more perfect and excellent, by any preparation, (ſince to the perfection, in which every thing is created, nothing can be added by art) but made more convenient by certaine ends; and yet not alwayes, ſeeing many things are more uſefull and better without prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then prepared; as the</p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:37337:105"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Bezar-Stone, and raſping of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne, againſt poyſens.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or the ſame, as if in hyſtericall paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Powder of Amber by the mouth, and Balſome exhibited below.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth that preparation alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, which taketh away the thicker earthy matter, ſeeing that it is more profitable in many effects, then the thin.</p>
                  <p>It may be here enquired, whether Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, in the body may be ſo digeſted by nature with the help of heat, as aliments; and whether every or ſome preparation of Medicines, may ſerve helpfull to this dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. The ſoule of man in the act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction (and cure by Medicines) uſeth the ſame heat, the ſame humours, vapours, and veſſels, thorough which alſo it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyeth the nouriſhment, and altereth the faculty of the Medicine, reſolveth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and by helpe of the humours, the earthy parts, and by this meanes, in this change, &amp; reſolution diminiſheth them, and ſeparateth the thicker parts from the thin.</p>
                  <p>In like manner the preparation of the firſt Aliment, and Medicament maketh it fit, that the Aliment may more eaſily be dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the heart; and heat and the humour paſſe thorough the Medicine and draw out
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:37337:106"/>his faculty, and lead it to the affected part; yet notwithſtanding ſome preparation ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the vertue or ſtrength, as we have ſaid of calcination. But this eſpecially differeth between either act.</p>
                  <p>That in the Act of concoction the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the firſt Aliment is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the temperament of blood; but of this in the temperament of the cure of the parts, the ſoule uſeth the temperament of the Medicine, uncorrupted, as much as may be, as well to the changing of the qualities, not naturall of the humours and parts, as to the evacuation of things hurtfull: ſo as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines may not properly be ſaid to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, or concocted.</p>

                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Powdering</hi> is, when a dry Medicine is reduced into Powder, by brufing or bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, that it may be the eaſier with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, either ſimply diſſolved or mixed: ſerving whereto, is drying of neat of the Sunne or fire; of which ſort alſo is that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, which is called reverberation. To many things, in bruſing them, ſome liquor
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37337:106"/>is added, which prohibiteth the dry exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or vapouring away of the ſmell; as Roſe-water to certain Aromaticall Spices; to Muſh, Ambergreeſe, &amp;c. Water to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, leaſt they caſt forth their Oyle; to the ſeed of Wild ſeme with Opium, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the clammineſs hindereth the bruſing, or breaking it; Ammoniacum, Galbanum, and ſuch as are of that kinde, are diſſolved in vineger, at the fire.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is ſome calcination imperfect, as when all the watry moiſtneſs is reſolved in the coales, ſomething aereall combuſtible being left; and when in like manner Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn by a reſolving water, the greateſt part of the matter which coagulateth or joyneth together by the help of heat, is reſolved and drawn forth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other calcination perfect, as when every coagulation is reſolved by fire onely, or other helping diſſolvers, without aſhes; as is performed in calcination of ſtones, and mettals, and when woods are burnt into aſhes.</p>
                  <p>All things calcined, or all aſhes, have a power of drying, and ſome have a greater, ſome a leſſer ſharpneſs.</p>
                  <p>The vertue or efficacy of drying, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: 1. Partly from the rarity or thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37337:107"/>in every thing, by which it can receive the humours into it ſelf. 2. Or from the hidden heat or flame, lying in the aſhes of ſtones, or lime burnt, in which, becauſe they are more folid, the flame (which inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated it ſelf in burning) lyeth hid; and after by the contrary qualities of water, that is, moiſtneſs, and cold, it is brought forth into act, whileſt the flame lurking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly reſiſteth the qualities of water, but nor ſo in oyle.</p>
                  <p>There is greater ſharpneſs in thoſe things, whoſe matter before burning was thick and ſharp; as Vitriall, rinde of an Oake, Wormwood, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>From this reaſon we exhibit charcoales to Cattle we intend to fat, eſpecially oaken coales, that their powder may eaſily be drawn by the veins, and paſſe thorough them, by reaſon of their thin and ſubtilneſs, and ſo may dilate the veines to make them receive a greater quantity of blood, may provoke the ſtomach by his acrimony, by his dryneſs, may draw the chyle and blood, and thence from may prevent Apoſthumes in men; eſpecially the coales of the Linden Tree, that the groſſeneſs of the blood may be cut, leaſt the Spirits ſhould be ſuffocated.</p>
                  <p>Of aſhes alſo, ſome are true, as of ſtones
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37337:107"/>and plants, from which all the liquor is truly carried away by the fire; ſome like, or ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall, as of metals who appear dry to the Senſes, but by their power keep in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their native liquor, by whoſe benefit they may be poured: forth, or altogether reduced: of which kinde is gold eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>From hence may be demanded, whether aſhes retain or keep any vertue or faculty of the Medicine, ſince the faculty whether hid or manifeſt, is not but in the tempare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by ſmell and ſavour; but in calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the temparement, odour, and ſavour, are altogether deſtroyed (for nothing is left but the earthy matter) but contrarily, in ſome of them, a ſtrange heat is induced, native coldneſs of the earth and acrimony, and in all things which have ſmell and taſte, a different ſmell and taſte; ſo that I can conclude no otherwiſe, but that there is nothing at all retained of the proper vertue of the Medicine in the aſhes.</p>
                  <p>The calcination of Iron, and <hi>Cyprian</hi> Braſſe (ſeeing they agree in ſubſtance, and onely differ in certaine accidents) is chiefly made from Sulphur, becauſe it is greedily drawn and imbibed, by theſe being hot, for the Sulphur, by his hidden accrimony and thinneſs, peircing, all the coagulation, or
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37337:108"/>matter, which holdeth and keepeth them together, is diſſolved and exhaled away: And whether the <hi>coagulum</hi> of other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, may be ſo diſſolved by looſning wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that the potentiall moiſtneſſe may bee reſolved into vapours; I much doubt of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Liquefaction,</hi> or <hi>melting,</hi> is generally an actuation, or working forth of moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lying hid in a dry body, by heat, (a waterie body excepted) but that ought ſo here to be, that the liquid matter remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by piercing may work that in the body, which by his vertue or facultie it is able to doe.</p>
                  <p>The materiall principles of which ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bodies conſiſt, are two, 1. Earth, and 2. Moiſtneſs, which are the ſubject of heat, upon which he worketh, for earth is the bound or limit of moiſtneſs.</p>
                  <p>Of humours or moiſtneſſe, ſome ſubſiſt by themſelves, all earthy matter being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: ſuch as is an airie wateriſhneſſe, which is: <hi>Spiritous</hi> or <hi>Oily.</hi> Both of which are inflammable, or apt to bee kindled. To theſe, as to the earthy matter, ſo many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall principalls are anſwerable in an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate bodie, (by which name that is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in theſe.)</p>
                  <p>Again the Olie hath three differences, for
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:37337:108"/>it is either from the far of living creatures, in plants, from which that which is drawn forth, yeeldeth his chief nouriſhment, or floweth by his own accord from ſtones, (as <hi>Petroleum</hi>) but is not fit for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a living body by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat, as alſo the reſt. And for the ſame cauſe, that which lyeth hid in amber, brimſtone, and waxe, (for that which lyeth hid in honey, is of one and the ſame kinde with oyle of waxe) But Manna and Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, becauſe they eaſily take fire, prove and ſhew a hidden oile in them; but then by reaſon of the ſcarcitie of the oile, as alſo for the plenty of the earthy mattter, that is firſt reſolved, and vapoureth away into ſmoke, before it is ſeparated from the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, there are others which are not actuated, or brought forth, but by heat, nor are kindled by themſelves (that is, do not nouriſh a flame) but the heat being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, return to their former dryneſſe.</p>
                  <p>And again of theſe things, there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſort or kinde.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 One ſort of plants, ſeeing that the aſhes of theſe melt.</item>
                     <item>2. Of Mettals. and theſe are fluxible, or run forth in the fire,</item>
                     <item>3. Of Minerals. and theſe are fluxible, or run forth in the fire,</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And truly theſe, cannot be ſeparated at all
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:37337:109"/>from their earthy matter, without their loſſe.</p>
                  <p>By the ſaid humours, or moiſtneſſe, wee underſtand the oilie, which is melted out, that it may preſerve, and keep his actuall moiſture, the which is done by mixing the oiles, (eſpecially thoſe of the ſame kinde) or alſo hot water, (for ſo we melt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Manna) or vinegar: (as we melt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins) for by this means, the earthy matter, overcome by the aiery; by the multitude, or by help of a little heat, continueth moiſt.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things eaſieſt melt, which the heat can eaſieſt penetrate: Notwithſtanding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1. The Soliditie or hardneſs which is in iron or braſſe: Or 2. coldneſs actual and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential which is in other mettals. Or 3. actual dryneſs, or ſcarcity of the oile contained, which is in Amber. But earth, and the ſaid watery and aierie humour, is not found in all ſublunarie bodies, nor can all ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie bodies be reſolved, (as <hi>Pſeudo-Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mices</hi> vainly imagine) into theſe principles. But of that Solution and Separation wee ſhall preſently handle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Expreſſion.</hi> By hand or preſſe (when greater ſtrength muſt be uſed) the jucineſſe is drawn from the plants and their parts: Or ſimply, the waterie or oilie juyce, by
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:37337:109"/>certain helps: As: 1. Almonds unhusked are drawn forth (leaſt the husk or rinde ſhould ſuck or imbibe a great part of the juyce) and being bruiſed that the oile with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hinderance may paſſe forth, through the thinner earthy parts, a little quantitie of roſe water is poured upon it, as well for ſmels ſake, as that it may come forth the readier; and after this manner an oile is drawn forth of the meal of the Seſame ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nutmeg is hung up in a covered ſtill, that it may touch the hot water, that the hot peircing vapours afterwards may carry away with them in the expreſſion, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oile.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yolks of eggs, boyled or fried in a frying pan unto hardneſs, more eaſily ſend forth their oile, being afterward preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From corn or grain put between two hot plates of iron, an oile is drawn forth, which is gathered together by heat.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Infuſion.</hi> Dry things are infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to liquor fit for our purpoſes, that by helps of actuall or potentiall heat, they may impart their vertue to the liquor, and ſo may bee more uſe fully received in at the mouth, or elſe that the hard may be ſoftned, or loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:37337:110"/>or that the liquor many correct ſome qualitie of the thing infuſed, or contrary. So we infuſe <hi>Rubarb,</hi> or the leaves of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> into hot water, (leſt the thin parts ſhould exhale by boyling) being well and cloſe covered, and leave them in a warm place, (and ſo likewiſe the leaves of Roſes, Rue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in vinegar) that the moiſture actually warm, paſſing through all the earthy parts, may receive into it ſelf, the vertue of thoſe things which is in the thin parts.</p>
                  <p>So Purgatives, or changing Medicines, being infuſed in wine, or ſpirit of wine, we place in a cold place, that the wine may not ſowr, and that the moiſture po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially hot, which I have ſaid it will make in the hot bath, that the moiſture by the actuall and potentiall heat, may work ſo much the ſtronger; but this latter is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Infuſion, and Concoction.</p>
                  <p>The thing infuſed are left the longer in the liquor, if the matter infuſed, bee the groſſer or harder, and the moiſture poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially hot; but leſſe while, if the liquor be more thin, and penetrateth more, and hath leſſe potential heat.</p>
                  <p>For you muſt take heed, that they ſtand not ſo long infuſed, that they may putrifie, or contract foulneſs, or hoarineſs.</p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:37337:110"/>
                  <p>To infuſion belongeth 1. We pour out a cold emulſion, (as for example ſake) with the ſeeds of Melons, or Pompeons, husked and bruiſed, and ſtrain them through a linnen cloth, ſo long as they will caſt forth a milkie juyce. 2. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lie. 3. When a hot iron, flint, or ſtone heated, communicateth their aſtriction to oile or water quenched.</p>
                  <p>That oile which they call Philoſophers oyle, taketh from the flame a very heating power, as well in this Infuſion, as in the following dry diſtillation. 4. When pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or things calcined, as either ſalt, and aſhes poured forth, receiveth the taſte and ſmell, and ſtrength of the juyces which they imbibe.</p>
                  <p>But Spirits ſuddenly reſolved exhale and vapour away, Being infuſed in ſalt, or aſhes flowing. 5. Lotion, as when the yellow colour, and troubleſome ſmell of turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is waſhed away with water, as alſo when the <hi>Cyancan,</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> ſtone are waſhed, oiles and fat, that the vitious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant qualities, and foul ſmell may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
                  <p>Lye, is a waterie or ſpiritous humour ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through aſhes. Therefore it is to bee valued as well from the nature of the aſhes, as the moiſture poured out on it, for from
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:37337:111"/>the aſhes, it hath his ſtrength of drying, cleanſing, and cutting by his ſharpneſſe, which the actuall and potentiall hear of the liquor poured forth increaſeth, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent it hath no ſtrength of ſoftning or conglutinating together.</p>
                  <p>If the moiſture poured on, be potentially hot, or cold, of the ſame nature will the lye bee alſo.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing the aſhes doth retain nothing of the vertue of the medicine, neither from the lye will any vertue be in it at all. The lightneſſe of the lye, ariſeth from that moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the aſhes, which we have ſaid is melted with a vehement fire, and advance the paſſage through the veſſels, taken by the mouth, and after the cleanſing of the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe away, induceth eſpecially a ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the skin of man.</p>
                  <p>In the ſaid faculties, and in the manner of generation, it is like to the wheyie part of blood, by which name it hath a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie with the reins and bladder, and from thence a dieuretick power of cutting the flegm, and de-obſtructing the veins. But it hath no ſweating power, unleſſe it bee got from good wine, or the Spirits of wine, nor of a counterpoiſon by it ſelf, unleſſe it be got from diſtilled waters, decoctions,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:37337:111"/>and infuſions of this kinde, or that plants reſiſting poyſon, be put in place of <hi>ſtrata,</hi> in the ſtraining through.</p>
                  <p>But by accident whileſt it reſiſteth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, and tough clammy poiſons by drying, and cutting, by urine and ſweatings, it carryeth along with it the poiſon, nature together thruſting forth the poiſon, by which advice, many drink their own urine in times when the aire is infected.</p>
                  <p>That mixture alſo is like to infuſion, when the oile and watery humour is mixed with the earthy matter, for when the oily hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour repelleth from it the water, contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the waterie may be eaſily dryed up with the earthy: ſo that thence it may eaſier ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the oile, it accordeth rather that the earthy matter be mingled before with the waterie moiſt, then with the oylic; ſo in the threefold medicine, lythargie, or white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, is firſt mingled with vinegar, and after with oyle.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Decoction.</hi> The humour is either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by the fire alone, or with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and earthy matter, untill that either for the moſt part, the waterie parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale away, as it is in boyling of ſalt water; 1. Of a Nitrous humour, of juyces, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That no occaſion of Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:37337:112"/>on may be given 2. The vitious or evill qualities exhale away. 3. Hard things may be ſoftned. 4. The Medicinable qualitie of the things infuſed, may bee communicated to the humour. 5. And that the moiſt pants may be exactly mixed and united with the earthy.</p>
                  <p>And theſe alſo are two ends of inſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when we expoſe into the ſun, oile, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or vinegar, with things infuſed, for this alſo is a certain decoction, or digeſtion, that the earthy matter, may be gathered together and ſettle, ſo that afterward it may be ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>That humour is either an oylie, or a wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie juyce drawn forth; water, wine, beer, ſweet wine, honyed wine, and vinegar. Fooliſhly called by ſome a <hi>menſtruum,</hi> ſince no Phyſicall infuſion or decoction requireth the ſpaces of a month, but may at the utmoſt be finiſhed in three daies ſpace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Decoction is made in a veſſell ſhut or cloſed, when we fear the loſſe or flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the ſubtile and thinner vapours. 2. Or in an open veſſell, when we would exhale offenſive qualities: There is need of being carefull about it, and looking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the matter, that it may not bee bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and of double clarifying it, either in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:37337:112"/>the bath, to keep in the faculties of the things infuſed, and to prevent <hi>Empyreuma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By reaſon of the delay, hard things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a long time (which for this cauſe ought firſt to be put in, and require more moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) in which their great abundance of moiſture is to be reſolved for avoiding pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction: 2. Leſſe hard, require a leſter time, when there is not ſuch great abundance of water to be reſolved; ſo we boil leaves, to the conſumption only of the fourth part of the water: 3. Flowers and Spice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſhort time, to the boyling of which, two or theee walmes will ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the decoction is reiterated or the infuſion, by a ſtraining or expreſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, that the thicker parts being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, thoſe which are thinner, may in the other decoction, bee mote exactly united together.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a certain naturall coction, as when new Wine boyleth up, or as new Beer brewed, Honey and water mixed, new Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome infuſions; when as the potentiall heat actuated, or put a working ſeparateth the groſſer parts from the thinner, (ſome advancing upward, and ſome ſetling downward, and reſolveth the thinner parts into vapours or ſpirits, which
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:37337:113"/>being ſcattered, if there be not ſpace, or iſſue enough to goe forth, the ſame break the veſſels a peices though very ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>Though according to the opinion of <hi>Actaurius,</hi> Sirrup, or a Julep, be water boyled with Hony or Sugar, or Wine boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the third part, yet at this day, all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions are called Sirrups, in which water with plants is boyled, either with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sugar or Hony; and Juleps when ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led waters, Rob, when the juyces are preſſed forth in an equall weight with Sugar, or boyled with a halfe part of Sugar. Sugar and Hony are added, for cleanſing, taſte, or luſting ſake: For by their clammineſs, as by a coagulation, it conſerveth the parts united.</p>
                  <p>In preparation of ſimple Sirrup, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance (as for example ſake) of flowers of Violets, or Roſes; it is beſt to have the juyce of Violets preſſed out, to be infuſed raw in Sugar clarified warme, (not boyling, leſt it exhale away ſome of the ſmell) and to ſet it into the Sunne, to reſolve away the ſuperfluous watry moiſtneſs; and if inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſuffice not, by inclining the veſſell to ſeperate that which is watry, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boyled again, to poure it on, for ſo the, ſmell and ſtrength of the Medicine will be
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:37337:113"/>preſerved, and kept more powerfully; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, our Reformer <hi>Quercetan,</hi> hath nothing he can more boaſt of.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing in Roſes, there is an aicry ſpirituous, and oyly matter, which either doth not enter the juyce, or is more drawn out by a fervent decoction; it is beſt, that Roſes be firſt infuſed in a boyling, or fervent decoction, and ſome houres after preſſed forth; and to this juyce other Roſes be put, and being about nine times iterated, by infuſion in Balneo (to prevent Empyreuma, and Evaporations) then that juyce at length preſt or ſtrained out, ſhould be boyled with about a third part of Sugar, to a fit conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence in <hi>Balneo Mariae:</hi> For ſince the purgative ſtrength of Roſes is rather placed in the earthy part, <hi>Quercetan</hi> erreth, whileſt he would have the digeſtion of the juyce at length drawn, or preſt forth, to be repeated in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and that which is clear to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, adding thereto the earthy parts.</p>
                  <p>But plenty of the ſaid flowers being wanting, infuſion in boyling water, the veſſell being well cloſed up, hath the next place; nor then is there any need of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum;</hi> it ſufficeth to be placed in a warme place for certain houres; or if you had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe the diſtilled water of Roſes, it
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:37337:114"/>ought not to boyle forth, but to be placed a while in <hi>Balneo</hi> with the Roſes.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a ſalt made or prepared by decoction out of ſalt waters: It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Salt, to bind and be ſharp, brachiſh, and of a watry of spring, by which name, it receiving into it ſelf a moiſt aire, forthwith melteth, as alſo others which from their firſt origine, are rather watry then earthy.</p>
                  <p>From hence it followeth, that no true Salt can be got out or Plants, yea, even from them which abound with Saltneſs: Such as are, Kaly, or Saltwort, and Sea-grape, or knotted Kaly: For which cauſe we refuſe, and altogether reject thoſe white Powders, which are made of ſodden lyes; whileſt lye filtered is ſtilled, till there remaineth in the bottome a thickneſe like Hony, which is dryed at the ſunne, or by the Fornace, and at length, for whiteneſs ſake, is burnt by a moderate fire in a Gold ſmiths pot, when they want a native genuine ſaltneſs; and if there be any, it is much inferiour to that in naturall Salt; when in like manner, the lye retaineth nothing of the nature of a Medicine (beſides ſharpneſs) much leſſe the foreſaid Powders, unleſs peradventure, thoſe which are void of all ſharpneſs, may be uſefull gently to dry, but will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:37337:114"/>the labour of making them, and coſt in their operation.</p>
                  <p>Neither can true Salt be gotten, or made out of urine. For if it be boyled or ſtilled, till the watery moiſture is reſolved into vapours, and the dregs be calcined, there ariſeth a Powder with an odious taſte; and if you poure water upon the thing calcined, and after draw it by diſtillation, you may truly waſh away the ſtinke; but you will have remaining, rather the taſte of Salt-peter, then of Salt.</p>
                  <p>But what madneſs is it to reckon Vitriall, Allum, and Sugar, in the number of Salts? where is their faltneſs, ſhall then likeneſs make all things the ſame.</p>
                  <p>In like manner alſo, by decoction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt are prepared, your Lohochs, your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuaries, candid things, Morſels, Pils, Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſces, Gliſters, Suppoſitories, Ointments, Pulteſſe, and Cerots.</p>
                  <p>In making your Medicines, which are called Lumbitives, and Arteriacks, from the rough artery, a Wind-pipe they mollifie. The <hi>Arabians</hi> call thoſe Medicines Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochs, which have power to mollifie the Breſt, ſtay Catarrhes or Rheumes, and cut flegme, and they make a decoction firſt to clammineſs, then adde Sugar Pennels, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:37337:115"/>boil it to the thickneſſe of honey and after expreſſion when it begins to cool, mingle the reſt in a morter, without decoction; as Vine kernels, ſweet Almonds husked, juyce of Liquorice, <hi>Tragacanth,</hi> and <hi>Gum Arabick, Ireos</hi> Roots, and white Starch, Becauſe their ſtrength will rather be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by decoction, then drawn forth.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing the cutting faculty is extream contrary to tough and thickning, and that the one weakneth the ſtrength of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſometimes they are wont with great overſight to be mixed together.</p>
                  <p>In like manner in Electuaries, they are firſt boyled in the ſame order, of which I have formerly adviſed you, thoſe things whoſe faculty may fitly be drawn forth by decoction, to the conſumption of their parts; there is after added a third part of Sugar, and then it is boiled up again to a conſiſtence, as well for taſte, as laſting, and laſt of all ſuch things are added, which are not fit to be boyled, ſuch as are conſerves, flowers of <hi>Caſſia,</hi> pulp of Prunes, <hi>Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindes, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>Sena</hi> leaves, <hi>Rubarb, Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, Coloquintida,</hi> are infuſed into the boyling decoction, and about twelve hours after, they may beſtreined with expreſſion, and the expreſſion forthwith boyled up to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:37337:115"/>a conſiſtence with Sugar, the reſt as I have ſaid being added.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things which we will preſerve, we firſt cleanſe, and throw away that in the roots which is woody, and by decoction we ſoften hard things, and take away the bitterneſs from bittter things, (though this rather ſerve for gluttonie then Phyſicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions) and being lightly dryed, we put Sugar to them warm boyled up to a fit thickneſſe (for too much heat ſhrinketh the fruit) till they are well covered, and then if any of the waterie moiſtneſſe appear, that being ſeparate, and reboyled is poured on: but ſome fruits (as for example ſake) Cherries are preſently dipped into the ſaid Sugar.</p>
                  <p>The ſoundneſſe of the Flowers is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (from whence they are called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) if unto them being ſmall bruiſed, a double part of Sugar carefully poudered be mingled, and expoſed to the Sun to drie up the watry moiſture, and therefore they are to be gathered in fair and dry weather, and the whites are to be clipt off from the roſes for their bitterneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Some times to gratifie the ſick, we min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle powders ſimple or compound, or diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led oiles with ſugar, and alſo medicines cut
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:37337:116"/>into ſmall parts: If the pouder be pleaſant or purging (that the purgative power may not be weakned by too great a proportion of ſugar) we mingle an ounce of it diſſolved and perfectly boyled with a dram of the ſaid ſugar in odoriferous water, or ſuch as ſhall ſerve for our purpoſe, but with pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders leſſe gratefull one dram, with two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Sugar, but of oile one ſcruple, with half a pound of Sugar, and the Sugar being boyled enough, remove it from the fire, beat it a good while with a Peſtle, untill the pouders or oile are well mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then poure it forth upon a Table, and frame out round pellets, or four ſquare Tablets or Lozenges, or Long (which they call Bits); Sometimes to the Sugar poudered we mingle onely ſome few drops of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled oile without any decoction: but this we have referred unto our Infuſions.</p>
                  <p>Pills called <hi>Cataphotia</hi> (becauſe they are ſwallowed) are made up either of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, or Pouders, moiſtned with ſome loſt humour of ſuch a bigneſſe, as any one may ſwallow them: an that they may not offend in ſmell or taſte, let them bee guilded. The cloſe is eſteemed by the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ingredient, <hi>v. g.</hi>
                  </p>

But Aloes though it looſen the belly; yet it is chiefly here inſerted, becauſe according to the opinion of <hi>Meſue</hi> it ſtrengtheneth all the bowels, (but eſpecially the Stomack and liver, by opening this, and cleanſing that) and by his thickneſſe correcteth the acrimonie or the reſt: Maſtich, and Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth by their clammineſs, corrected the ſharpneſſe; the ſeed of Fennell and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe, Saffron, and Roſes, correct the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which is offenſive to ſtomack, brain, and heart; and alſo prepare and fit the flegm, by cutting and cleanſing it: Aloes, Parſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſeed, and the other ſeed. And becauſe gentle purgatives are mixed with ſtrong and vehement pursers, there is almoſt the ſame quantity of correctors, that is, ten dragms, as of Purgatives, which are eleven drams: And whereas a doſe of Pills ought not to exceed four ſcruples: this Maſſe ought to be divided into about 20. drams, by which name, there ſhall be in every doſe of Aloes, Scammonie, Coloquintida, whoſe higheſt doſe is ij. ℥ and 12. grains, of each 15. grains, and 3. grains, And to every Pill ſhall have of vehement Purgers 18.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:37337:117"/>grains, which doſe is therefore the greater, becauſe the correctors, doe not a little dull and weaken the ſtrength of the Purgers.</p>
                  <p>By the like reaſon round orbicular Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets or Trochiſes are framed, the ſtrength of Agarick being an enemy to the ſtomack, is corrected by wine, in which ginger is macerated; and with Tragacanth (which is ſlow and dull) an Union is made of the broken and ſcattered parrs; And the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and malignitie of Coloquintida in the Trochiſes of <hi>Alhandal.</hi> For ten ounces (ſome read evilly ſo many Dragms, for otherwiſe the Purgatives ſhould be much overcome by the Correctives, which were ſaulty) are rubbed with oyle of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, for one whole dupe; and then they are reduced into a Maſte, or body, by the infuſion of four ounces of Roſewater, of Bdellium, Gum Arabick, and Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth, of each nine Dragms. The Maſſe being again dryed in the ſhadow being very ſmall beaten, is at length with the ſaid infuſion brought into a paſte.</p>

                     <hi>Clyſters</hi> are profitable in vomiting, when the ſick hold not thoſe things which they receive at the mouth, or when they can receive nothing by the mouth: They are good in a hard belly to looſen it, and the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:37337:117"/>dregs or excrements; and in a fluid or moiſt, to binde the ſame, and to thicken the excrements, or mollifie the ſharpe.</p>
                  <p>For Ulcers in the guts, to cleanſe and glew them together, and for diſeaſes of the belly, of the reines, and bladder, for they can work ſtrongly upon theſe parts, by diſcuſſing the vapours and windineſs.</p>
                  <p>Looſning may be cauſed in one of full age, by a pinte of fleſh pottage, of decoction, of milk, barly, or emollient herbes, of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or whey ſtrained (that the paſſages may be cleanſed) and of Sugar or hony boyled (leaſt windineſs may be moved) halfe an ounce ſtrained for cleanneſs; ſometimes inſtead of hony, we take pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Electuaries in the ſame or leſſe quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, according to their faculty, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſtrength, and by reaſon of the diſeaſe, of oyle, or fat (by reaſon of the dryneſs of the inteſtines, and excrements) three ounces or five; then we add, when the ſharpneſs of the reſt is not ſufficient to provoke, and advance the worke, or the ſenſe is duller in the night gut, about a dram of ſalt, ſometimes we add a yolke or two, to waſh and cleanſe the guts, that they may not be hurt by the ſharpneſs of the humours, or to dull the ſtirring or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking faculty.</p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:37337:118"/>
                  <p>Sometimes (if there be no obſtruction preſent, for otherwiſe, heat by drying cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and increaſeth obſtruction) in a cold diſtemper, a Gliſter is made of Muſcadine, or Spaniſh wine, with an ounce of ſeeds diſcuſſing winde, boyled and ſtrained hot, and mingled with halfe an ounce of Treacle, So you may gather by theſe, the uſe of the reſt: When we would have Cliſters kept a good while, we exhibite them in a leſſer quantity, decocted, and avoid all ſharpe things.</p>
                  <p>When either age, or cuſtome will not endure Gliſters; as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They that ace troubled with piles, or Ulcers of the Fundament, are offended with Glyſters; or if Glyſters and Purges doe not work, we will draw them from the head, or the midriffe, as in old diſeaſes, or of the ſtomach; then we put up Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitories into the Fundament of young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to looſen them, of Butter, or Larde, 2. And unto people of full age, provoking and cleanſing of the root or Beet ſcraped, annoynted with a littie Butter, ſprinckled with a little Salt and Hony boyled up into hardneſs, whew the Fundament doth not perfectly feele or is moved, wee'l put on it a little purging Powder, or otherwiſe

The dry plants are ſod with equall portions, of Wine, Butter, Oyle; that the aquoſity or watry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Wine, may as well reſtraine the collection of foule corrupt matter; and that the fire by inſinuating his heat, may not change the temper of the ointment; and that the ſpirituous parts, peircing by their thinneſſe, may draw out the ſpirituous and oylſe part which is in them, and may com municate it to the oyle.</p>

                  <p>In diſtillation which is made downward, either a Paper is put upon the juycie plants, having a linnen cloth ſpread over the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or diſh with good ſtore of ſand, to which hot coales are put; for aſſoon as the heat hath drawn forth the vapours, when they are reſtrained from being lifted up, being grown together, they fall down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the platter ſet under in drops.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe in roſinie woods, being inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a Potters veſſell, coales being placed about them, which draw forth by their powerfull heat, that which is fattie; from whence the oile floweth, by a cover with holes (without the earthy matter) into a veſſell ſet under, (ſet cloſe to the earth for refrigeration ſake) or amber melteth after
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:37337:121"/>this manner in ſuch a veſſel, but that the thinner part or the earthy matter may not paſſe through the holes, we uſe dry ſand, or pouder or flints, or tiles, or aſhes of bones burnt, and to waſh away the ſtench and blackneſs, a veſſell below is filled up to the half with water, into which the falling drops ſlide or fall into another veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſet under of purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>In diſtillation which is ſpeedily made upward, the Spirits are ſeparated from the water, by an Inſtrument of a large neck, which they call <hi>Phyola,</hi> a plain pot with a wide mouth, whileſt as I ſaid, the former are liſted up; aſſoon therefore as the waterie vapours ſucceed, the receiving veſsell is to be changed; the other ſhut up the wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vapours with a ſpunge, or parchment paper, ſet upon the cucurbite.</p>
                  <p>In this kinde of diſtillation, ſharp, tart vapours, have this peculiar, that after (for example ſake) the waterie vapours ariſing out of Vinegar, Salt, Vitrioll, Allum, Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, are lifted up; they are ſeparated firſt: without Acrimonie, (therefore wee ſuffer the ſaid vapors of Vitrioll to exhale before diſtillation in an open Veſsell) and that which is left of the waterie humour, the ſtronger heat doth by boyling more exactly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:37337:121"/>mingle with the ſubtiler earthy parts; till at the length it ſeparateth and driveth forth that violently from the thicker matter.</p>
                  <p>That is called water of Salt, &amp;c. unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully oyle, ſeeing it hath nothing common with oyle, beſides the thicker conſiſtence apparent; but Spirit (though improperly, ſince every Spirit is inflamable, and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, or virtually hot by it ſelfe) it may be called for his potentiall heat, but accidentall (for this from fire, which hath inſinuated it lelſe, and ſharpneſs partly from fire from the ſaid mixture) in which it differs from the nature of water, and agrees with the Spirits: If therefore thoſe Spirits ſeparated againe, be poured upon the earthy matter, forthwith the vapours goe forth much ſharper and hotter, and by reaſon of their aiery and fiery nature, ſuffer themſelves to be ſhut up very heavily, by which cauſe the recipient veſſell ought to be very ample and large, leaſt it break, before the concretion be made of the vapours.</p>
                  <p>To Diſtillation, which is made upward a little Wine, or Water is ſprinckled on the freſh Plants, which are not juycie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that you may draw away the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the dry; If you deſire onely wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſomething ſpirituous they are powred
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:37337:122"/>into water, wine, be water, if it be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous it ſelfe. And they are left in <hi>Balneo</hi> for 24. houres, that the vertue may be the more communicated and imparted to the humour.</p>
                  <p>But if you would adde freſh Floures ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered at divers times, the infuſion is to be made in the Spirit of wine, in a cold place, leaſt by placing they may be corrupted.</p>
                  <p>For example, Cinamon water; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken ſmall, is hanged in a peece, in a blinde limbech, filled with water, ſo as the water may not touch the bag; then let the water boyle till all the parts of the Cinamon be moiſt and warme fitly; then take out the Cinamon, and beat it into paſte, and then again let it be infuſed and diſtilled in the former water.</p>
                  <p>If thou deſireſt Spirit, and Oyle out of Plants, you ought to boyle the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alwayes, either in his proper humour or moiſtneſs: So red Roſes exquiſitely bruſed, and ſtopt up in a glaſſie veſsell, and plac'd in a cellar, till the potentiall heat actuates, and the moiſture boyles up, compelled by the <hi>Antiperiſtaſmi,</hi> or repulſion on every part of the cold.</p>
                  <p>Cherries with their kernels (for the Spirits lye incloſed in them) are placed in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:37337:122"/>a warme place, the Lees of Wine or Oyle being poured upon them, that their heat lying hid, may ſtir up the Spirit till it boyle up. Or with water poured on, and the ſaid lees, as is done before the diſtillation of the Spirits, and the Oyle.</p>
                  <p>Juniper berries, Wheat, &amp;c. are firſt to be bruſed, that the water may peirce all the parts, and the Spirit with the Oyle may unite unto it. If you ſeparate the Spirits from the water, by diſtillation ſometimes repeated, at the length you ſhall have the moſt pure Spirits, together with the Oyle from all Plants potentially hot.</p>
                  <p>None but a foole, will call thoſe Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or Macerations putrefaction, becauſe this is an innated deſtruction of heat, that the actuation thereof, and this is a progreſs not unto perfection, (as that) but a paſſage to the corruption of the thing.</p>
                  <p>If there be a little part of oyle in it, the dry matter ought to be infuſed into the Spirits, that they may peirce the more, and draw the oyle with it.</p>
                  <p>The purging force, taſte, ſweet, bitter, ſalt, and the colour, ſeeing it is placed in the thicker earthy matter, they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the humour in diſtilling (nor the ſmell of the purple violet, &amp;c. by reaſon
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:37337:123"/>of the ſmalnes of the odoriferous exhalation) as it chiefly appeares in the example of ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Roſes purging, in whoſe Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water drawes away nothing, but the Aſtringent facultie; (under which it ſtayeth the looſeneſs of the belly without Inflammation) the purging part being left in the dregs; and this very Obſervation miniſtred the firſt occaſion to Extraction,</p>
                  <p>If water diſtilled (as for example) of Roſes, bee often poured on freſh Roſes; the diſtillation being iterated. by ſo much the more his ſtrength is increaſed; but the ſame doured upon the Lees, forthwith to ſtill, as the water of Capons, were to ſpend time fooliſhly, ſeeing that the qualities of fleſh are communicated not by diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by decoction.</p>
                  <p>When the moſt ſubtile earthy matter is mixed with oile only, as in Waxe, Sulphur, Roſins, Amber, then there is required to the diſtillation, ſome looſing ſpirituous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which may carry the oile along with it; an humour, and earthy matter, which may keep back <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> and Aduſtion, and the aſcenſion of the ſubtle earthy matter.</p>
                  <p>Such looſing things which effectuate all theſe together are common, Salt, <hi>Sal gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi> Salt-peter, Salt Ammoniack, plume Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:37337:123"/>pure ſand, aſhes of bones burnt, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of flints, and Tiles or Bricks, theſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hinder the aſcent of the earthy matter.</p>
                  <p>Diſtilled vinegar, and ſpirit of wine, have truly a looſing power, and carry the oyle with them: but to the diſtillation of Amber are impertinent, becauſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend before the Amber melteth, and ſo preſerve it not from the heat or violence of the fire.</p>
                  <p>If the firſt diſtillation of Amber be made rightly, there doth not need another in <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi> which they call rectification, for ſo much as the water waſheth or taketh away of his colour, ſo much it taketh away of his ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Pitch; and Colophonie, by reaſon of their great viſcoſitie and groſsneſs, before are ſod with rich wine to the conſumption of the wine; that Allum afterward added may ſo much the eaſier paſſe or penetrate, this liquid matter, and the oyle ſeparated from the earthy matter, may aſcend more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
                  <p>There is another kind of diſtilling of oile, when hot glowing Bricks or Tiles, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in peeces, are quenched in the oil (from whence it is called oyle of Bricks): becauſe it taketh from the fire his grew heat, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:37337:124"/>from the Bricks his Aſtriction; and being after reduced into powder, are forced out by a ſtrong fire; that by this means they may alſo receive more heat and aſtriction, and by the ſame manner oyle of quick lime is prepared: And ſeeing it is the nature of oile, and of oylie things, that being put to the fire they are preſently inflamed; theſe if they be actually drie, they ſwim above the water, contrary to all reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Amongſt Oyles are reckoned, ſpirit, as I ſaid of ſalt, the water being concrete from the vapours of brimſtone, ſet on fire under a bell.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Extract of Cinnamon, which ſetleth at the bottome in water diſtilled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The moiſtneſs which is drawn from Wormes being ſtopt up with paſte in a glaſſe, with heat of an Oven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Or which from Couſlip flowers, and by inſolation is drawn forth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And when in like manner the white of an egge, hung in a pot with Camphire, floure of Brimſtone, or Myrrhe, or Tartar burnt, mixt with a ſharp moiſture, the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs vaniſhing or vapouring away, which they received or took from the heat, they return into their former watery nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Oile is ſought from ſtones,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:37337:124"/>Jewels, Mercurie, Antimonie, mettals, and out of all thoſe things, which have now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore felt the ſtrong reſolving force of fire; from Cryſtall, Tartar, Corall, Pearls, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar which hath an extream contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Yea though Salt-peter, and Manna alſo are preſently inflamed, yet the ſcarcity of Oyle is much overcome by the earthy and cold waterie matter, ſo that rather that which is oylie in it may be conſumed by the fire, then ſeparated by diſtillation from the ſaid matter.</p>
                  <p>To draw oyle from blood by diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to mock God, by whoſe Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nature in the third concoction hath wrought out oyle from blood more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, that is to ſay, fat, tallow, butter, which if after the common Liquefaction or coction of fleſh, and bruiſed bones from water, thou requireſt more pure, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parament being unhurt, thou ſhalt ſome daies of Harveſt ſet in the ſun, that thou mayeſt ſeparate the pureſt from the dregs ſetled downward.</p>
                  <p>But behold how in a matter ſo hard and difficult they trifle here, which exhibite a Mutinie of which it appeareth not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the dryed fleſh of a man or a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:37337:125"/>beaſt, and whether it came to a true Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; or whether it dyed not by poiſon, or whether or not they were not the late carcaſes of many men, rather annointed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with Myrrhe, Aloes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then with true Balſom, and though true Balſom was uſed to the bodies of great men, whether in ſo long a time, the force and vertue bee not gone forth and expired, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the corruption which was joyned with it, whether the Indian or Succeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Balſum, made from Oyle of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Cloves, and the like things were not much more excellent.</p>
                  <p>Now when your Oyles are diſtilled, and your ſpirits, whether thoſe ſo mixt, in <hi>Hermes</hi> veſſel by boyling them longer, it behoveth to mingle them more exactly, that from thence they may draw an <hi>Elixir:</hi> (which theſe Triflers call <hi>Circulati</hi>) one of the two Homogeneall principles, that is to ſay, of the aire.</p>
                  <p>One truly increaſeth the heat and ſmell of the other, and the ſame faculty or ſtrength which is in the ſmell, but here obſerve the madneſs of <hi>Quercetan,</hi> above or beyond all his other doatings, he mingleth (<hi>pag.</hi> 60. <hi>Lips. edit.</hi>) 59. Medicines, which every on 1. Either ſtrengtheneth the principall parts,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:37337:125"/>2. Refreſheth the ſpirits 3. Breaketh the ſtrength of poyſons. 4. Reſiſteth putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clion. 5. Cutteth groſſe thick humours: And he calleth it a ſpecifique Medicine to cure inveterate diſeaſes, giddineſs, falling-ſickneſſe, palſie, madneſs, melancholy; but how that may be called a ſpeciall or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique Medicine, which is compoſed of ſo many different ſpecies or ſorts, which is directed for diſeaſes, which are moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in cauſes, and in kindes.</p>
                  <p>Seeing this Medicine conſiſteth for the greateſt part of hot things, and heat may be increaſed in diſtillation, with ſo frequent, and ſo much fire, it ought to be moſt hot, how then can it be profitable to ſome hot cauſes of theſe diſeaſes?</p>
                  <p>How can the ſtrength which is placed in the earthy matter, and in the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſaid Medicines, theſe being deſtroyed remain, all the reſt being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and taken away. Beſides his manner preparation is full of vanities and deceits, why are the firſt ſpirits diſtinctly taken, when afterward they are to be mixed? what need is there to pour forth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits upon the lees or dregs preſt out, or calcined; the ſpirits being lifted up, if the oyle bee not carried together with them.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:37337:126"/>How only doth that, and that which is pure aſcend afterward? what have honey and ſugar here to doe.</p>
                  <p>To a dry deſtillation, ſublimation alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, for it is done after the ſame manner by ſand, when the moſt thin earthie matter of Sulphur, Salt, Antimonie, green ruſt of Braſſe, and Stibium, is elevated by a ſtrong fire, till it ſtick to the ſides of the Still, like a moſt thin pouder. I diſtill, I ſay, of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone (leaſt all the earthy matter may not be lifted up) and of Vitriol calcined, and ſalt poured forth (that all the waterie humour may be taken away)of each equall parts, and I increaſe the fire more and more, whilſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Sulphur aſcendeth, when it coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth again, I add again to the Sulphur, ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, taken away of the ſaid Vitriol and Salt, of each equall parts, and in the like manner or reaſon; diſtill it.</p>
                  <p>Almoſt after the ſame manner, are flowers of Stibium made, (but that to the correcting of his virulency, and leaſt he ſhould inflame in calcination) Salt-peter, and Tartar is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; theſe being together ſet on fire, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined in an earthen veſſell, that the poyſon may exhale away; what is calcined we waſh with water, (to diminiſh and leſſen the viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency) let what is waſhed be melted, and the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:37337:126"/>melted powdered and elevated in a ſmal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limatory, for it aſcends ſlow and heavily.</p>
                  <p>By the like reaſon from Quick-ſilver, to which, re-purged by Oxalmen, <hi>aqua fortis</hi> made of vitriall, and Salt-peter is added; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>aqua fortis</hi> again by diſtilling is drawn away, &amp; that is thrice poured on with <hi>aqua fortis;</hi> then to the Mercury beaten Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of vitrial is poured, that ſo for the ſpace of 24 hours, the Spirits may exhale at a ſtrong fire. Laſtly, I digeſt that Powder, either in Spirit of Wine upon Sand, in a bilnd Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bech, and to theſe poured out put on others, and do ſo thrice, that I may have the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; or elſe I increaſe the fire in a ſmall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limatory underneath, till the glaſſe is fired or heated with a purple brightnes, and a citrine or red flowers aſcend, (and ſo I have the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate) upon which I poure the Spirit of Wine, and after take them away by diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the diſtillation being thrice repeated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here, I pray, obſerve Reader.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That an actuall humidity is taken from Mercury, by exhalation, whoſe cauſe is fire, which actuatech the exhalation, and <hi>aqua fortis</hi> (which by the ſimpathy it hath with Mercury) by reaſon of the original humidity, receiving the fire into it ſelfe, otherwiſe avoyding this enemy of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:37337:127"/>cury, detaineth the Mercury in the fire; and by this meanes taketh away his actuall coldneſs and moiſtneſs, by exhalation of his actuall humour; ſo that the moiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining parts which are in him, are more exactly mixed with his earthy matter; by which mixture and inſinuation of fire into Mercury, it taketh his ſtrong ſharpneſs, and cauſtick power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Mercury by interveniency of <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> receives the fire into it ſelfe, is manifeſt from his colour; firſt white, and then yellow, with redneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But whether from Mercury and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony his venenoſity, from Sulphur his ſharpneſs, by this or the like manner may be diminiſhed or taken away, experience will teach thee the contrary; therefore take none of them into your bodie, whatſoever preparation be made of them, and beleeve not <hi>Quercetan</hi> whoſe primary Chymick Medicines, are Mercuric, Antimonie, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Spirits.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the drying cauſe ceaſing, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie returneth to his former humiditie is the chiefeſt argument: that that ſhould be numbred amongſt the mettals; but in all his nature it is contrary to mettals, although it doth very much counterfeit a ſimpathie;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:37337:127"/>Since from heat, and <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> it may be reduced into powder, but reduced into liquor from theſe: Mettals offer violence unto mettall, when it is mixed with thoſe melted: For it maketh thoſe ſoft, which naturally ought to be hard.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Extraction, properly ſo called, is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of a moſt ſubtile earthie and oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie matter, (if there be any in it) with his faculty or ſtrength by Infuſion, Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Diſtillation, as well as from his thicker earthy matter, as well as from his moiſt waterie, the ſpirits for the moſt part exhaling together. For by Infuſion and Expreſſion, the moſt pure earthy and oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie matter, is communicated to the liquor, and the thicker ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>By diſtillation the waterie humour is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated to the conſiſtence of honie, or new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine ſodden to the conſumption of the third part, and the remaining matter is exactly mingled in boyling: although thoſe extracts which want oyle, nor were infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſpirit of wine, are afterward dryed altogether in the heat for preventing pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, from whence the ſtrength of the Medicine is greater in a ſmall portion, then in a great, whileſt as yet the thicker mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the liquor are joyned together.</p>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:37337:128"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quercetan</hi> biddeth, that the matter yet warme, if it be oylie, (as it is in <hi>Guiacum</hi> wood, and <hi>Saſſafras,</hi> and Juniper Barke) bee poured forth into a glaſſe diſh or plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, full of Water for coagulation ſake: but that is all on, whether it be done or intermitted, for it is nothing available for Phyſick intentions.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Extraction</hi> chiefly are requiſite and fit, ſimple and compound Medicines, brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in peeces, (that the liquor may more eaſily penetrate) which have their ſtrength eſpecially placed in the earthy matter, ſuch as are thoſe chiefly, which are of a ſtrong ſmell and raſte, and moſt part purging.</p>
                  <p>From liquors, 1. water, water diſtilled of the ſame kinde, or which are ſerviceable for the Phyſicall intention. 2. Wine, and Spirit of Wine. Theſe truly more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the matter, and by mingling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the moſt ſubtile parts, ſooner draw forth the ſtrength, and longer bear the ſtay or continuance of the Infuſion without Putrefaction; but worke it ſo that the Extract may better agree with hot temperament or diſeaſes, becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are rather carried upward then down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>It is fit and convenient that Infuſion and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:37337:128"/>Meceration ſhould be made in <hi>Balneo,</hi> in a Veſſel moſt carefully ſtopt (that nothing may breath out) that by help of the actuall heat, the humour may penetrate the more, and imbibe the facultie.</p>
                  <p>The time of Maceration or ſoaking, is to be judged from the conſideration of the things infuſed (for hard and Roſinous things ſuch as Guiacum, are macerated to ſtirre them) till the liquor poured on is min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled ſufficiently with the oylie matter, or is ſufficiently tincted or affected with the colour, or ſavour of the medicine; for then either other liquor is poured on the ſame matter, and that ſo often reiterated, till ſuch time as it is no more affected with tincture or ſavour, and then at length all the liquors affected, are put together and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled, the Extract being left in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Veſſel or Bladder: After this manner Rubarb, Rhapeticum, Aloes, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Myrrhe, or elſe the ſaid liquor affected, is poured on the plant of the ſame kinde, and it is twice or thrice reiterated: So is Cinnamon, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, leſſer Centurie, Angelico root, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doarie, Galingal, the true Acorns, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecompane root, which neither give tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, not are indued with manifeſt ſmell
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:37337:129"/>or favour; they are macerated, or ſoaked for one day or two, and then the liquor preſſed forth is poured upon a plant of the ſame kind, and this is done twice or thrice: In like manner diſtillation is made in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choaſhau, Bryonie, Pyonie, Maſterwort root, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Extraction of freſh Flowers, of Peaches, Plums, Roſes, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, Herbs, and Roots of Celandine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no need of effuſion, or putting on of any other moiſture, but the reiterated, preſſing forth or the juyce often, ought to go before the diſtillation, and the Infuſion into the moiſture preſſed forth of the freſh Flowers, and Herbes: But to bruiſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine, and diſtill it, and to put the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled water, upon the dry Lees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is trifling to no purpoſe, in ſo great plenty of Celandine, experience it ſelf in the ſtrength of either Extraction will be teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing the Extract of the Roots of Bryonie, Ireos, and Cuccopintle may be made after three manners: That is to ſay, That either dryed, they may be infuſed in ſpirit of Wine, the juice preſſed forth out of the freſh Roots diſtilled: Left in a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for a few dayes, and then the white troubled water poured forth, the white
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:37337:129"/>Lees may be dried in the ſhadow.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion is, which way may beſt draw forth the ſtrengths or vertues of them; for perſons troubled with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Hydropicks, or thoſe which have an ill habit of bodie. <hi>Quercetan</hi> preferrteh the third way, I the firſt; Lee reaſon and experience conclude the controverſies and determine it.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, heat is required in all the three Effects, or Diſpoſitions, which here the Spirits of Wine adminiſter to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Crude juyce is leſſe apt, becauſe it is it ſelfe a phlegmatick matter, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but be corrupted by the moist aire of the Cellar, and hath nothing which may preſerve it from corruption.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The faculties of theſe conſiſt not in the thin matter which goeth forth with the Water diſtilled, but rather in the thick earthy matter, as their Pouders ſhew plainly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quercetan,</hi> in glutinous and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie roots addeth a half part of white bread in their Infuſion (that the nouriſhment mixt with the Medicine, may as well by his clammineſs incrcaſe his glutinous ſtrength, as derive, or convey, the Medicine the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the liver,) and being all moiſtned
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:37337:130"/>with wine, placeth them in <hi>Balneo</hi> till they become red, and moreover digeſteth the juyce waxing red (that it may become the redder) being preſſed forth; for truly the ſimple man thinketh the red juyce will be ſooner turned into blood, and ſo alſo the red wine, (and by the long ſnout of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagers</hi> Bear) before diſtillation: But I ſay, we may more commodiouſly draw forth the nature from bread exhibited by it ſelfe; but if there be need of extraction of the glutinous or clammy part from corne, and drawing the Medicine through the veines; all true Phyloſophers (not ſuch Sophiſters) will with me, preferre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction far before it, with which the thick glutinous <hi>Danſick</hi> Beer is made, if with the ſaid extract (made without bread) that may be mingled.</p>
                  <p>He alſo infuſeth black Hellebar in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, (being moſt adverſe to the ſpleen) to draw forth the faculty for diſeaſes of the ſpleen, and will have the proper ſalt mixed with the diſtilled waters, as alſo others with the extracts; to what end I pray? for ſeeing every faculty which was in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, before calcination, by this is taken away; whether that he may corrupt the extract, or water by his ſharpneſs, or by
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:37337:130"/>his dryneſs keep back putrefaction; or that beyond others he may ſeeme to ſavour better. The ſame man extolleth without any judgement his oleous extract of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achum;</hi> for ſeeing in the cure of the French diſeaſe, and the Catarrhe, there is firſt or chiefly required ſome aſtriction, by which the members may be ſtrengthned together; truly for this intention, every man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands decoction to be far more needfull and uſefull, which hath any judgement; although a ſmall doſe of the extract, be fit for thoſe which ſhall uſe it, eſpecially for delicate and tender perſons.</p>
                  <p>And in his Extract of mans Skull, he is altogether childiſh, as of the Secondine, a Calves liver and lungs, Pearls, and Corrals.</p>
                  <p>For what doth he draw forth of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from the Skull, other then a certaine fat, and ſomething from the earthy matter, and aſhes by decoction in <hi>Balneo?</hi> but will that Extract take away the cauſes of ſuch a diſeaſe as the Falling-ſickneſs? he will hardly perſwade children to it: from the Secondine, Liver, and Lungs, what I pray, can be drawn? the broth of their decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea, even the ſubſtance it ſelfe eaten, and the powder of the Secondine; will it not offer nature the ſtrength it ſelfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:37337:131"/>to be extracted? Pearles and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals onely beaten, will yeeld all their vertue they have received from Gold, without any trouble of diſſolving or waſhing with water of corroſive ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Whether hitherto have not all kinde of preparation of Medicines been unfolded by us: Truly they have been altogether: But where are their Medicines ſo much cryed up, their Secrets, their Magiſteries, Mercuries, Sulphurs, Elixirs, Tinctures, Quinteſcence. This Talkative Chymick <hi>Apollo,</hi> hath invented and framed words without matter,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> from that infernall deſire of lying and couſening, to gain to his Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters authoritie, an opinion of ſubtile wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>But if we ſhall ſpeake properly, a Secret and Magiſterie are the ſame, nor are they ſpeciall, but moſt generall Appellations of wittie Inventions; And the tincture is the Extraction of the proper colour, which ſeeing it is not a Medicinable qualitie, it ought to be moſt eſtranged and alienate from true Phyſick preparations. I omit that for the moſt part it is ſophiſticated (as for example) ſpirit of wine, draweth his red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from white bones and aſhes, and black Treacle; and this every liquor potentially
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:37337:131"/>hot will perform, eſpecially if the earthy matter bee alſo endued with heat, which Turners doe, who ſhave pure white plates, —from yellow Amber: But this is of an Optick contemplation: When we Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans would expreſſe a thing diſſolved by concoction, and ſay it is neither boyled nor roaſted; Of which kind peradventure, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir</hi> might firſt get his name.</p>
                  <p>A Quinteſcence preſuppoſeth four other things: If they reckon up the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this Quinteſcence will be ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine thing, which is falſe, ſeeing from a corruptible Elementarie bodie, a divine thing is not made, (being different in the whole kind) perpetuall, light ſome, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a circular motion, and ſeeing they are ſeparated alſo by a moſt long diſtance of places.</p>
                  <p>Neither is Mercurie it ſelf ſo inconſtant and mutable, as they are in defining their Mercurie and Sulphur; they have often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to my face, that by theſe terms they have meant a Quinteſcence.</p>
                  <p>From all which it is moſt apparent, that great wrong hath been done to the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts;</hi> 1. Whileſt the <hi>Paracelſians</hi> object, and obtrude ignorance unto them of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:37337:132"/>of their Medicines, and impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrogate the knowledge of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to themſelves onely. 2. Whileſt <hi>Quercetan</hi> aſcribes onely to himſelfe by his New <hi>Phamcopea</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and skill of this Art, in which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he hath brought in, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated nothing at all, hee hath diſcuſſed nothing by their cauſe anſwerable to a wiſe mans judgement, he hath expoſed or ſet forth nothing of his own invention of any worth or moment; what he received or got from the Germans in his travell, he venteth it forth for his own inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hath propounded and ſet many things forth of divers kindes, falſe and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and which are not pertinent to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries trade and profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>And contrarily he hath left out and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted better ancient Medicines, and hath thruſt worſe in the place of them, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many manners and wayes of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which chiefly the Art pf compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making up of Medicines requires; For which ſeverall cauſes, this <hi>Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copea</hi> doth rather deſerve to bee ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, A Bundle without Method, of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Medicines to blind and deceive men
